        "question": "Turbo the snail sits on a point on a circle with circumference 1. Given an infinite sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$. Turbo successively crawls distances $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ around the circle, each time choosing to crawl either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nFor example, if the sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ is $0.4,0.6,0.3, \\ldots$, then Turbo may start crawling as follows:\n<img_3362>\n\nDetermine the largest constant $C>0$ with the following property: for every sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ with $c_{i}<C$ for all $i$, Turbo can (after studying the sequence) ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.",
        "solution": [
            "The largest possible $C$ is $C=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $0<C \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$, Turbo can simply choose an arbitrary point $P$ (different from its starting point) to avoid. When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument. There might be even more possible examples.",
            "To show that $C\\le \\frac12$\n\nWe consider the following related problem:\n\nWe assume instead that the snail Chet is moving left and right on the real line. Find the size $M$ of the smallest (closed) interval, that we cannot force Chet out of, using a sequence of real numbers $d_{i}$ with $0<d_{i}<1$ for all $i$.\n\nThen $C=1 / M$. Indeed if for every sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots$, with $c_{i}<C$ there exists a point that Turbo can avoid, then the circle can be cut open at the avoided point and mapped to an interval of size $M$ such that Chet can stay inside this interval for any sequence of the from $c_{1} / C, c_{2} / C, \\ldots$, see Figure 5 . However, all sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ with $d_{i}<1$ can be written in this form. Similarly if for every sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$, there exists an interval of length smaller or equal $M$ that we cannot force Chet out of, this projects to a subset of the circle, that we cannot force Turbo out of using any sequence of the form $d_{1} / M, d_{2} / M, \\ldots$. These are again exactly all the sequences with elements in $[0, C)$.\n\n<img_3381>\n\nFigure 5: Chet and Turbo equivalence\n\nClaim: $M \\geqslant 2$.\n\nProof. Suppose not, so $M<2$. Say $M=2-2 \\varepsilon$ for some $\\varepsilon>0$ and let $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ be a minimal interval, that Chet cannot be forced out of. Then we can force Chet arbitrarily close to $\\pm(1-\\varepsilon)$. In partiular, we can force Chet out of $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$ by minimality of $M$. This means that there exists a sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ for which Chet has to leave $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, which means he ends up either in the interval $\\left[-1+\\varepsilon,-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ or in the interval $\\left(1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon\\right]$.\n\nNow consider the sequence,\n\n$$\nd_{1}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{2}, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, d_{3}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nobtained by adding the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ in between every two steps. We claim that this sequence forces Chet to leave the larger interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed no two consecutive elements in the sequence $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ can have the same sign, because the sum of any two consecutive terms is larger than $2-2 \\varepsilon$ and Chet would leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. It follows that the $\\left(1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's and the $\\left(1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon\\right)$ 's cancel out, so the position after $d_{k}$ is the same as before $d_{k+1}$. Hence, the positions after each $d_{k}$ remain the same as in the original sequence. Thus, Chet is also forced to the boundary in the new sequence.\n\nIf Chet is outside the interval $\\left[-1+\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon, 1-\\frac{4}{3} \\varepsilon\\right]$, then Chet has to move $1-\\frac{7}{6} \\varepsilon$ towards 0 , and ends in $\\left[-\\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{6} \\varepsilon\\right]$. Chet then has to move by $1-\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon$, which means that he has to leave the interval $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Indeed the absolute value of the final position is at least $1-\\frac{5}{6} \\varepsilon$. This contradicts the assumption, that we cannot force Chet out of $[-1+\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$. Hence $M \\geqslant 2$ as needed."

Let $b(n)$ be the number of full tables with someone in seat 2 (and thus nobody in seat 1). Let $c(n)$ be the number of full tables with nobody in seat 1 or in seat 2 .\n\nSince every full table must be in one of these categories, then $f(n)=a(n)+b(n)+c(n)$. A full table with $n$ seats $n \\geq 4$ must correspond to a string that starts with 10,01 or 00 . Since there cannot be more than two consecutive 0s, we can further specify this, namely to say that a full table with $n$ seats must correspond to a string that starts with 1010 or 1001 or 0100 or 0101 or 0010 . In each case, these are the first 4 characters of the string and correspond to full (1) and empty (0) chairs.\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 1010. Note that such strings end with 0 since the table is circular. Removing the 10 from positions 1 and 2 creates strings of length $n-2$ that begin 10. These strings will still correspond to a full table, and so there are $a(n-2)$ such strings. (We note that all possible strings starting 1010 of length $n$ will lead to all possible strings starting with 1010 of length $n-2$.)\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 1001. Note that such a string ends with 0 since the table is circular. Removing the 100 from positions 1, 2 and 3 creates strings of length $n-3$ that begin 10. (There must have been a 0 in position 5 after the 1 in position 4.) These strings will still correspond to full tables, and so there are $a(n-3)$ such strings. Consider the full tables starting with 0100 . Removing the 100 from positions 2,3 and 4 creates strings of length $n-3$ that begin 01 . (There must have been a 1 in position 5 after the 0 in position 4.) These strings will still correspond to full tables, and so there are $b(n-3)$ such strings.\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 0101. Removing the 01 from positions 3 and 4 creates strings of length $n-2$ that begin 01 . (The 1 in position 4 must have been followed by one or two 0s and so these strings maintains the desired properties.) These strings will still correspond to full tables, and so there are $b(n-2)$ such strings.\n\nConsider the full tables starting with 0010. These strings must begin with either 00100 or 00101.\n\nIf strings start 00100 , then they start 001001 and so we remove the 001 in positions 4,5 and 6 and obtain strings of length $n-3$ that start 001 (and thus start 00). There are $c(n-3)$ such strings.\n\nIf strings start 00101, we remove the 01 in positions 4 and 5 and obtain strings of length $n-2$ that start 001 (and thus start 00 ). There are $c(n-2)$ such strings.\n\nThese 6 cases and subcases count all strings counted by $f(n)$.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n) & =a(n-2)+a(n-3)+b(n-3)+b(n-2)+c(n-3)+c(n-2) \\\\\n& =a(n-2)+b(n-2)+c(n-2)+a(n-3)+b(n-3)+c(n-3) \\\\\n& =f(n-2)+f(n-3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas required, which means that the number of different full tables when $n=19$ is 209 .",

If there are exactly 2 consecutive gaps of length 2 , there are 4 relative places in which the third gap of length 2 can be placed.\n\nIf there are no consecutive gaps of length 2 , these gaps can either be separated by 1 gap each (21212111) with 3 gaps on the far side, or can be separated by 1 gap, 2 gaps, and 2 gaps (21211211). There is only one configuration for the gaps in this last situation.\n\nThere are 7 different circular orderings for these 8 gaps.\n\nEach of these 7 different orderings can be placed around the circle of 19 chairs in 19 different ways, because each can be started in 19 different places.

Because the chairs are around a circle, if there were 3 , 4 or 5 gaps with 2 empty chairs between them, there would be 2,1 or 0 gaps going the other way around the circle.\n\nThis means that there are 3 different configurations for the gaps.\n\nEach of these configurations can be placed in 19 different ways around the circle of chairs.

That is, we draw the rectangle with horizontal sides along the lines $y=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $y=-4$ and vertical sides along the lines $x=0$ and $x=4$. We label this rectangle as $B P Q R$.\n\n<img_3586>\n\nThe area of $\\triangle B D C$ equals the area of the rectangle minus the areas of $\\triangle B P D, \\triangle D Q C$ and $\\triangle C R B$.\n\nRectangle $B P Q R$ has height $4+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{9}{2}$ and width 4 .\n\n$\\triangle B P D$ has height $\\frac{9}{2}$ and base 3 .\n\n$\\triangle D Q C$ has height $\\frac{1}{2}$ and base 1.\n\n$\\triangle C R B$ has height 4 and base 4.\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle B D C$ is $4\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)(3)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(1)-\\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=18-\\frac{27}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}-8=3$.\n\nMethod 2\n\nWe determine the coordinates of $E$, the point where $B D$ crosses the $x$-axis.\n\n<img_3686>\n\nOnce we have done this, then the area of $\\triangle B D C$ equals the sum of the areas of $\\triangle E C B$ and $\\triangle E C D$.\n\nSince $B$ has coordinates $(0,-4)$ and $D$ has coordinates $\\left(3, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, then the slope of $B D$ is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}-(-4)}{3-0}=\\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{3}=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nSince $B$ is on the $y$-axis, then the equation of the line through $B$ and $D$ is $y=\\frac{3}{2} x-4$. To find the $x$-coordinate of $E$, we set $y=0$ to obtain $0=\\frac{3}{2} x-4$ or $\\frac{3}{2} x=4$ or $x=\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nWe think of $E C$ as the base of each of the two smaller triangles. Note that $E C=4-\\frac{8}{3}=\\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the area of $\\triangle E C D$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nAlso, the area of $\\triangle E C B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)(4)=\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle B D C$ is $\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{8}{3}=3$."

Either $p_{n}=0$ or $p_{n}=1$.\n\nConsider first the case when $p_{n}=0$. (Here, $p_{1}$ can equal 0 or 1.)\n\nThese strings are all of the form $p_{1} p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots p_{n-1} 0$.\n\nIn this case, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nThus, these strings can all be built using $k 10$ blocks and $n-2 k 0$ blocks. This gives $k$ 1 's and $k+(n-2 k)=n-k 0$ 's. Note that any string built with these blocks will be allowable and will end with a 0 , and any such allowable string can be built in this way.\n\nThe number of ways of arranging $k$ blocks of one kind and $n-2 k$ blocks of another kind is $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+(n-2 k) \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nConsider next the case when $p_{n}=1$.\n\nHere, we must have $p_{n-1}=p_{1}=0$, since these are the two digits adjacent to $p_{n}$.\n\nThus, these strings are all of the form $0 p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots 01$.\n\nConsider the strings formed by removing the first and last digits.\n\nThese strings are allowable, are of length $n-2$, include $k-11$ 's, end with 0 , and can begin with 0 or 1 .\n\nAgain, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nTranslating our method of counting from the first case, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}(n-2)-(k-1) \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ or\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nThus, $f(n, k)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nIn order to look at divisibility, we need to first simplify the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n, k) & =\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k-1 \\\\\nk-1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-k-k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !((n-k-1)-(k-1)) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k)}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) ! k}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k+k)}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1) !}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+2)(n-2 k+1)}{k !}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that we have written $f(n, k)$ as a product, it is significantly easier to look at divisibility.\n\nNote that $2009=41 \\times 49=7^{2} \\times 41$, so we need $f(n, k)$ to be divisible by 41 and by 7 twice. For this to be the case, the numerator of $f(n, k)$ must have at least one more factor of 41 and at least two more factors of 7 than the denominator.\n\nAlso, we want to minimize $n+k$, so we work to keep $n$ and $k$ as small as possible.\n\nIf $n=49$ and $k=5$, then\n\n$$\nf(49,5)=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5 !}=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5(4)(3)(2)(1)}=49(43)(14)\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by 2009 .\n\nWe show that this pair minimizes the value of $n+k$ with a value of 54 .\n\nWe consider the possible cases by looking separately at the factors of 41 and 7 that must occur. We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ). In this case, we already know that $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ and now we also have $50+k \\leq n \\leq 48+2 k$.\n\nFor these ranges to overlap, we need $50+k \\leq 40+2 k$ and so $k \\geq 10$, which means that $n \\geq 50+k \\geq 60$, and so $n+k \\geq 70$, which is not minimal.\n\n* Next, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nHere, $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ (to include 41 in the product) and $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nSince $k$ is at least 2 by definition, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 44$, so $n$ is at least 49 .\n\nIf $n$ was 56 or more, we do not get a minimal value for $n+k$.\n\nThus, we need to have $n=49$. In this case, we do not need to look for another factor of 7 in the list.\n\nTo complete this case, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which 49 is in the range from $42+k$ to $40+2 k$ because we need to have $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nThis value of $k$ is $k=5$, which gives $n+k=49+5=54$.\n\nSince $f(49,5)$ is divisible by 2009 , as determined above, then this is the case that minimizes $n+k$, giving a value of 54 ."

            "First consider a regular octahedron of side length 1. To compute its volume, divide it into two square-based pyramids with edges of length 1 . Such a pyramid has slant height $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and height $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its volume is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1^{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6}$. Thus the octahedron has volume twice that, or $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The result of folding the net shown is actually the image of a regular octahedron after being stretched along an axis perpendicular to one face by a factor of $r$. Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3368>\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$. Then $P Q=R_{C}-R_{I}$, where $R_{C}$ is the circumradius and $R_{I}$ the inradius of the equilateral triangle. Thus $P Q=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Then $B P^{2}=P Q^{2}+B Q^{2}=\\frac{3}{36}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{3}$, so $A P^{2}=A B^{2}-B P^{2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, and $A P=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nNow let a vertical stretch take place along an axis parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{A P}$. If the scale factor is $r$, then $A P=\\frac{r \\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and because the stretch occurs on an axis perpendicular to $\\overline{B P}$, the length $B P$ is unchanged, as can be seen below.\n\n<img_3791>\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6 r^{2}}{9}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{6 r^{2}+3}{9}$.

The two rings are connected by the edges $E=\\left\\{A_{1} B_{1}, A_{2} B_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6} B_{6}\\right\\}$. Each vertex in the figure has exactly three edges joining it with the neighboring vertices. Also note that any closed loop must use exactly two edges (out of three) for each vertex.\n\nFurther note that a loop must use at least one edge from $E$ to move from one ring to the other. Consider two cases: the loop uses all six edges from $E$, or it uses some but not all of them.\n\nIf all edges from $E$ are used, there are two possible undirected loops. It is not possible to use both edges $A_{1} A_{2}$ and $B_{1} B_{2}$, so either $A_{1} A_{2}$ or $B_{1} B_{2}$ will be used. This choice determines how the entire loop is constructed.\n\nIf not all edges from $E$ are used, then there must be some $i$ for which the loop uses the edge $A_{i} B_{i}$ and does not use $A_{i+1} B_{i+1}$ (where $A_{j} B_{j}$ represents $A_{j-6} B_{j-6}$ if $7 \\leq j \\leq 12$ ). Because $A_{i+1}$ is only connected to three other vertices, the loop must use $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1} A_{i+2}$, and similarly must use $B_{i} B_{i+1}$ and $B_{i+1} B_{i+2}$. This also precludes using $A_{i+2} B_{i+2}$, because doing so would close the loop before it visits all 12 vertices. Therefore the loop must also use $A_{i+2} A_{i+3}$ and $B_{i+2} B_{i+3}$, which now precludes using $A_{i+3} B_{i+3}$. This continues to force the structure of the loop until it closes by using $A_{i+5} B_{i+5}=A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use exactly two edges from $E$, and they must be consecutive: $A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose those two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nThe forced path is a loop, and the only way the given conditions are satisfied if $A_{i+k}=A_{i-1}$ and $B_{i+k}=B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use (precisely) two consecutive edges from $E: A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nEach undirected loop can be traced in two ways, and thus the number of ways for Xena to trace the path is $(6+2) \\cdot 2=16$."

        "question": "This Question involves one Robber and one or more Cops. After robbing a bank, the Robber retreats to a network of hideouts, represented by dots in the diagram below. Every day, the Robber stays holed up in a single hideout, and every night, the Robber moves to an adjacent hideout. Two hideouts are adjacent if and only if they are connected by an edge in the diagram, also called a hideout map (or map). For the purposes of this Power Question, the map must be connected; that is, given any two hideouts, there must be a path from one to the other. To clarify, the Robber may not stay in the same hideout for two consecutive days, although he may return to a hideout he has previously visited. For example, in the map below, if the Robber holes up in hideout $C$ for day 1 , then he would have to move to $B$ for day 2 , and would then have to move to either $A, C$, or $D$ on day 3.\n\n<img_3859>\n\nEvery day, each Cop searches one hideout: the Cops know the location of all hideouts and which hideouts are adjacent to which.

For a map $M$, let $h(M)$ be the number of hideouts and $e(M)$ be the number of edges in $M$. The safety of a hideout $H$ is the number of hideouts adjacent to $H$, and is denoted by $s(H)$.\n\nThe Cop number of a map $M$, denoted $C(M)$, is the minimum number of Cops required to guarantee that the Robber is caught.\n\n\nThe police want to catch the Robber with a minimum number of Cops, but time is of the essence. For a map $M$ and a fixed number of Cops $c \\geq C(M)$, define the capture time, denoted $D(M, c)$, to be the minimum number of days required to guarantee a capture using $c$ Cops. For example, in the graph below, if three Cops are deployed, they might catch the Robber in the first day, but if they don't, there is a strategy that will guarantee they will capture the Robber within two days. Therefore the capture time is $D\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{6}, 3\\right)=2$.\n\n<img_3546>\nDefinition: The workday number of $M$, denoted $W(M)$, is the minimum number of Cop workdays needed to guarantee the Robber's capture. For example, a strategy that guarantees capture within three days using 17 Cops on the first day, 11 Cops on the second day, and only 6 Cops on the third day would require a total of $17+11+6=34$ Cop workdays.\n\nDetermine $W(M)$ for each of the maps in figure a and figure b.\n<img_3641>\nfigure a\n\n<img_3880>\nfigure b",
        "solution": [
            "or the map $M$ from figure a, $W(M)=7$. The most efficient strategy is to use 7 Cops to blanket all the hideouts on the first day. Any strategy using fewer than 7 Cops would require 6 Cops on each of two consecutive days: given that any hideout can be reached from any other hideout, leaving more than one hideout unsearched on one day makes it is impossible to eliminate any hideouts the following day. So any other strategy would require a minimum of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nFor the map $M$ from figure b, $W(M)=8$. The strategy outlined in $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ used three Cops for a maximum of four workdays, yielding 12 Cop workdays. The most efficient strategy is to use 4 Cops, positioned at $\\{B, E, H, K\\}$ for 2 days each. The following argument demonstrates that 8 Cop workdays is in fact minimal. First, notice that there is no advantage to searching one of the hideouts between vertices of the square (for example, $C$ ) without searching the other hideout between the same vertices (for example, $D$ ). The Robber can reach $C$ on day $n$ if and only if he is at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n-1$, and in either case he could just as well go to $D$ instead of $C$. So there is no situation in which the Robber is certain to be caught at $C$ rather than at $D$. Additionally, the Robber's possible locations on day $n+1$ are the same whether he is at $C$ or $D$ on day $n$, so searching one rather than the other fails to rule out any locations for future days. So any successful strategy that involves searching $C$ should also involve searching $D$ on the same day, and similarly for $F$ and $G, I$ and $J$, and $L$ and $A$. On the other hand, if the Robber must be at one of $C$ and $D$ on day $n$, then he must be at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n+1$, because those are the only adjacent hideouts. So any strategy that involves searching both hideouts of one of the off-the-square pairs on day $n$ is equivalent to a strategy that searches the adjacent on-the-square hideouts on day $n+1$; the two strategies use the same number of Cops for the same number of workdays. Thus the optimal number of Cop workdays can be achieved using strategies that only search the \"corner\" hideouts $B, E, H, K$.\n\nRestricting the search to only those strategies searching corner hideouts $B, E, H, K$, a total of 8 workdays can be achieved by searching all four hideouts on two consecutive days: if the Robber is at one of the other eight hideouts the first day, he must move to one of the two adjacent corner hideouts the second day. But each of these corner hideouts is adjacent to two other corner hideouts. So if only one hideout is searched, for no matter how many consecutive days, the following day, the Robber could either be back at the previously-searched hideout or be at any other hideout: no possibilities are ruled out. If two adjacent corners are searched, the Cops do no better, as the following argument shows. Suppose that $B$ and $E$ are both searched for two consecutive days. Then the Cops can rule out $B, E, C$, and $D$ as possible locations, but if the Cops then switch to searching either $H$ or $K$ instead of $B$ or $E$, the Robber can go back to $C$ or $D$ within two days. So searching two adjacent corner hideouts for two days is fruitless and costs four Cop workdays. Searching diagonally opposite corner hideouts is even less fruitful, because doing so rules out none of the other hideouts as possible Robber locations. Using three Cops each day, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Robber evades capture for three days before being caught: for example, if $B, E, H$ are searched for two consecutive days, the Robber goes from $I$ or $J$ to $K$ to $L$. Therefore if three Cops are used, four days are required for a total of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nIf there are more than four Cops, the preceding arguments show that the number of Cops must be even to produce optimal results (because there is no advantage to searching one hideout between vertices of the square without searching the other). Using six Cops with four at corner hideouts yields no improvement, because the following day, the Robber could get to any of the four corner hideouts, requiring at least four Cops the second day, for ten Cop workdays. If two or fewer Cops are at corner hideouts, the situation is even worse, because if the Robber is not caught that day, he has at least nine possible hideouts the following day (depending on whether the unsearched corners are adjacent or diagonally opposite to each other). Using eight Cops (with four at corner vertices) could eliminate one corner vertex as a possible location for the second day (if the non-corner hideouts searched are on adjacent sides of the square), but eight Cop workdays have already been used on the first day. So 8 Cop workdays is minimal."

Then $[B D G]=[D E G]=18$ because the triangles have equal bases and heights. Because $D, G$, and $F$ are collinear, to compute $[B G F]$ it suffices to find the ratio $D G / G F$.

If a mass of weight 1 is placed at vertex $B$ and masses of weight 2 are placed at vertices $A$ and $C$, then $\\triangle A B C$ balances on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{B F}$ and also on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{C E}$.

For example, in the $p$-signature $(. ., 2143,2431, \\ldots), 2143$ and 2431 are compatible. Notice that the last three digits of 2143 and the first three digits of 2431 can be described by the same 3-label, 132 .\n\nTheorem: A signature $\\sigma$ is possible if and only if every pair of consecutive windows is compatible.\n\nProof: $(\\Rightarrow)$ Consider a signature $\\sigma$ describing a $p$-label $L$. If some pair in $\\sigma$ is not compatible, then there is some string of $p-1$ numbers in our label $L$ that has two different $(p-1)$-signatures. This is impossible, since the $p$-signature is well-defined.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\\sigma$ is a $p$-signature such that that every pair of consecutive windows is compatible. We need to show that there is at least one label $L$ with $S_{p}[L]=\\sigma$. We do so by induction on the number of windows in $\\sigma$, using the results from $5(\\mathrm{~b})$.\n\nLet $\\sigma=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$, and suppose $\\omega_{1}=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{p}$. Set $L_{1}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nSuppose that $L_{k}$ is a $(p+k-1)$-label such that $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}\\right\\}$. We will construct $L_{k+1}$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k+1}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAs in $5(\\mathrm{~b})$, denote by $L_{k}^{(j)}$ the label $L_{k}$ with a $j+0.5$ appended; we will eventually renumber the elements in the label to make them all integers. Appending $j+0.5$ does not affect any of the non-terminal windows of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]$, and as $j$ varies from 0 to $p-k+1$ the final window of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$ varies over each of the $p$ windows compatible with $\\omega_{k}$. Since $\\omega_{k+1}$ is compatible with $\\omega_{k}$, there exists some $j$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$. Now we renumber as follows: set $L_{k+1}=S_{k+p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$, which replaces $L_{k}^{(j)}$ with the integers 1 through $k+p$ and preserves the relative order of all integers in the label.\n\nBy continuing this process, we conclude that the $n$-label $L_{n-p+1}$ has $p$-signature $\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is possible.\n\nTo count the number of possible $p$-signatures, we choose the first window ( $p$ ! choices), then choose each of the remaining $n-p$ compatible windows ( $p$ choices each). In all, there are $p ! \\cdot p^{n-p}$ possible $p$-signatures."

            "The answer is $p=16$. To show this fact we will need to extend the idea from part 8(b) about \"linking\" inequalities forced by the various windows:\n\nTheorem: A $p$-signature for an $n$-label $L$ is unique if and only if for every $k<n, k$ and $k+1$ are in at least one window together. That is, the distance between them in the $n$-label is less than $p$.\n\nProof: Suppose that for some $k$, the distance between $k$ and $k+1$ is $p$ or greater. Then the label $L^{\\prime}$ obtained by swapping $k$ and $k+1$ has the same $p$-signature, because there are no numbers between $k$ and $k+1$ in any window and because the two numbers never appear in the same window.\n\nIf the distance between all such pairs is less than $k$, we need to show that $S_{p}[L]$ is unique. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, let $r_{i}$ denote the position where $i$ appears in $L$. For example, if $L=4123$, then $r_{1}=2, r_{2}=3, r_{3}=4$, and $r_{4}=1$.\n\nLet $L=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$. Since 1 and 2 are in some window together, $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}$. Similarly, for any $k$, since $k$ and $k+1$ are in some window together, $a_{r_{k}}<a_{r_{k+1}}$. We then get a linked inequality $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}<\\cdots<a_{r_{n}}$, which can only be satisfied if $a_{r_{1}}=1, a_{r_{2}}=$ $2, \\ldots, a_{r_{n}}=n$. Therefore, $S_{p}[L]$ is unique.\n\nFrom the proof above, we know that the signature is unique if and only if every pair of consecutive integers coexists in at least one window. Therefore, we seek the largest distance between consecutive integers in $L$. That distance is 15 (from 8 to 9 , and from 17 to 18). Thus the smallest $p$ is 16 ."

Such a placement is called okay if in every pair of adjacent squares, either one square is blank or the difference between the two numbers is at most 2 (two squares are considered adjacent if they share a common side). If reflections, rotations, etc. of placements are considered distinct, compute the number of distinct okay placements.\n\n<img_3937>",
        "solution": [
            "We say that two numbers are neighbors if they occupy adjacent squares, and that $a$ is a friend of $b$ if $0<|a-b| \\leq 2$. Using this vocabulary, the problem's condition is that every pair of neighbors must be friends of each other. Each of the numbers 1 and 8 has two friends, and each number has at most four friends.\n\nIf there is no number written in the center square, then we must have one of the cycles in the figures below. For each cycle, there are 8 rotations. Thus there are 16 possible configurations with no number written in the center square.\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 4 | - | 5 |\n| 6 | 8 | 7 |\n\n\n| 3 | 1 | 2 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 5 | - | 4 |\n| 7 | 8 | 6 |\n\nNow assume that the center square contains the number $n$. Because $n$ has at least three neighbors, $n \\neq 1$ and $n \\neq 8$. First we show that 1 must be in a corner. If 1 is a neighbor of $n$, then one of the corners neighboring 1 must be empty, because 1 has only two friends ( 2 and $3)$. If $c$ is in the other corner neighboring 1 , then $\\{n, c\\}=\\{2,3\\}$. But then $n$ must have three\n\n\n\nmore friends $\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}\\right)$ other than 1 and $c$, for a total of five friends, which is impossible, as illustrated below. Therefore 1 must be in a corner.\n\n| - | 1 | $c$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $n_{1}$ | $n$ | $n_{2}$ |\n|  | $n_{3}$ |  |\n\nNow we show that 1 can only have one neighbor, i.e., one of the squares adjacent to 1 is empty. If 1 has two neighbors, then we have, up to a reflection and a rotation, the configuration shown below. Because 2 has only one more friend, the corner next to 2 is empty and $n=4$. Consequently, $m_{1}=5$ (refer to the figure below). Then 4 has one friend (namely 6) left with two neighbors $m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$, which is impossible. Thus 1 must have exactly one neighbor. An analogous argument shows that 8 must also be at a corner with exactly one neighbor.\n\n| 1 | 2 | - |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 3 | $n$ | $m_{3}$ |\n| $m_{1}$ | $m_{2}$ |  |\n\nTherefore, 8 and 1 must be in non-opposite corners, with the blank square between them. Thus, up to reflections and rotations, the only possible configuration is the one shown at left below.\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $m$ |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $2 / 3$ | $4 / 5$ | $6 / 7$ |\n| $3 / 2$ | $5 / 4$ | $7 / 6$ |\n\nThere are two possible values for $m$, namely 2 and 3 . For each of the cases $m=2$ and $m=3$, the rest of the configuration is uniquely determined, as illustrated in the figure above right. We summarize our process: there are four corner positions for 1; two (non-opposite) corner positions for 8 (after 1 is placed); and two choices for the number in the square neighboring 1 but not neighboring 8 . This leads to $4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=16$ distinct configurations with a number written in the center square.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 configurations in which the center square is blank and 16 configurations with a number in the center square, for a total of $\\mathbf{3 2}$ distinct configurations."
