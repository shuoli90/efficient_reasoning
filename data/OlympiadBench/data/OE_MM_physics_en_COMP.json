        "question": "For his art project, Weishaupt cut out $N=20$ wooden equilateral triangular blocks with a side length of $\\ell=10 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and a thickness of $t=2 \\mathrm{~cm}$, each with the same mass and uniform density. He wishes to stack one on top of the other overhanging the edge of his table. In centimeters, what is the maximum overhang? Round to the nearest centimeter. A side view is shown below. Assume that all triangles are parallel to each other.\n\nNote: This diagram is not to scale.\n\n<img_4256>",
        "solution": [
            "Let us consider $N=1$ equilateral triangles. From inspection, we need to place the triangle such that the center of mass lies at the edge of the table. The maximum overhang in this case is $(1-f) h$ where $h=\\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the height of the triangle and $f h=\\frac{h}{3}$ is the location of the center of mass.\nIf we wish to place a second triangle on top, we want to maximize the center of mass to be as far right as possible without the top block toppling. Placing the second block such that its center of mass is at the tip of the first triangle accomplishes this. However, the center of mass of the two triangles combined is now past the edge. Their center of mass is:\n\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\frac{f h+h}{2}=\\frac{f+1}{2} h\n$$\n\nThus the maximum overhang of the first block is now:\n\n$$\nh-\\frac{f+1}{2} h=\\frac{1-f}{2} h\n$$\n\nNow, we will place a third block such that it has the maximum overhang with respect to the top block and then shift the entire setup so that the center of mass of the system lies at the edge of the table. Following the same procedures, we find that the maximum overhang of the first block is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-f}{3} h\n$$\n\nThe overhang of the top two blocks are $(1-f) h$ and $\\frac{1-f}{2} h$, unchanged from earlier. You can show via induction that the maximum overhang of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ block (counting from the top downwards) is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-f}{n} h\n$$\n\nso if there are 20 such blocks, then the total overhang (summing over all the blocks) is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{20} \\frac{1-f}{k} h=(1-f) h H_{20}=\\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{2} H_{20}=\\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{3} H_{20}=20.77 \\mathrm{~cm} \\approx 21 \\mathrm{~cm}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{N}$ is the $N^{\\text {th }}$ harmonic number."

Thus, at such points, when the vertical velocity is plotted against the horizontal velocity, the curve will be tangent to a circle centered at the origin because $v_{y}^{2}+v_{x}^{2}$ is nonchanging at that instant.\nThis is equivalent to stating that the line from the origin to the curve is perpendicular to the curve.

            "Define point $O$ as the point in the plane that the axis of rotation passes through. Since moments of inertia simply add about a given axis, we can calculate the moments of inertia of the three \"sectors\" whose union forms the given area and subtract twice the moment of inertia of the triangle, so our answer will be $3 I_{s, O}-2 I_{t, O}$.\nClaim: The center of mass of a sector is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the vertex of the sector along its axis of symmetry. Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It's well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$. Then, the $x$-coordinate of a point on the arc whose corresponding radius makes an angle of $\\theta$ with the axis of symmetry is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta)$. We can integrate this over all possible angles $\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$ and then divide by the range $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ to get the average $x$-coordinate, or the center of mass.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)-\\sin \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\n\nThis concludes the proof.\n\nNow define point $X$ as the vertex of a sector and point $M$ as the center of mass of that sector. According to the parallel axis theorem,\n\n$$\nI_{s, X}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n. It's well known that $I_{s, X}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{s} r^{2}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}$, and so\n\n$$\nI_{s, M}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}-\\frac{4 m_{s}}{\\pi^{2}}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}-8}{2 \\pi^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's also well known that $O$ is on the line of symmetry and a distance of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ away from $X$, and so $M X=$ $\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nI_{s, O}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's well known that, since $O$ is the center of mass of the triangle,\n\n$$\nI_{t, O}=\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\nNow we just need to calculate $m_{s}$. Since the mass of the triangle is $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$, this is equivalent to finding the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of a triangle. Through geometry, this is found to be $\\frac{2 \\pi}{3 \\sqrt{3}}$. Finally, we get our answer to be\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)-\\frac{1}{6}=\\left(\\frac{10 \\pi-17 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $a+b+c+d+e=10+17+3+6+3=039$"

        "question": "Consider a long uniform conducting cylinder. First, we divide the cylinder into thirds and remove the middle third. Then, we perform the same steps on the remaining two cylinders. Again, we perform the same steps on the remaining four cylinders and continuing until there are 2048 cylinders.\n\nWe then connect the terminals of the cylinder to a battery and measure the effective capacitance to be $C_{1}$. If we continue to remove cylinders, the capacitance will reach an asymptotic value of $C_{0}$. What is $C_{1} / C_{0}$ ?\n\nYou may assume each cylindrical disk to be wide enough to be considered as an infinite plate, such that the radius $R$ of the cylinders is much larger than the $d$ between any successive cylinders.\n<img_4266>\n\nNote: The diagram is not to scale.",
        "solution": [
            "The capacitance is proportional to $C \\propto \\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the distance between successive parallel plates. When we add capacitor plates in series, their effective capacitance will be:\n$$\nC \\propto\\left(\\frac{1}{1 / d_{1}}+\\frac{1}{1 / d_{2}}+\\cdots\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{1}{d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdots} \\Longrightarrow C \\propto \\frac{1}{d_{\\text {total }}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, this essentially becomes a math problem: What is the total length of the spacing in between? Between successive 'cuts', the length of each cylinder is cut down by $1 / 3$, but the number of gaps double. Therefore, the spacing grows by a factor of $2 / 3$ each time. For $n=2^{1}$, the spacing starts off as $1 / 3$. For $n=2^{10}$, the spacing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{\\text {eff }}} \\propto d=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1-(2 / 3)^{10}}{1-2 / 3}\\right) L=0.983 L\n$$\n\nfor $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, it is clear the total spacing will converge to $L$.

Alice ensures the center of mass of her car is at the rear and Bob puts the center of mass of his car at the very front. Otherwise, their cars are exactly the same. Each car's time is defined as the time from when the car is placed on the top of the ramp to when the front of the car reaches the end of the flat track. At the competition, Alice's car beat Bob's. What is the ratio of Bob's car's time and Alice's car's time?\n\nAssume that the wheels are small and light compared to the car body, neglect air resistance, and the height of the cars are small compared to the height of the ramp.

The goal of Pico-Pico is to flick the ball from the beginning of the track (point $A$ ) such that it is able to traverse through the track while never leaving the track, successfully reaching the end (point $B)$. The most famous track design is one of parabolic shape; specifically, the giant track is of the shape $h(x)=5-2 x^{2}$ in meters. The starting and ending points of the tracks are where the two points where the track intersects $y=0$. If $\\left(v_{a}, v_{b}\\right]$ is the range of the ball's initial velocity $v_{0}$ that satisfies the winning condition of Pico-Pico, help Poncho find $v_{b}-v_{a}$.

What is the minimum initial speed required for the ball to make this shot?\nNote: For this problem, you may assume that the size of the ball is negligible.",
        "solution": [
            "For this part, we regard the basketball as a point mass. Now to account for the backboard bounce, we reflect the hoop over the backboard. The problem is now equivalent to making it into the hoop that is 4.15 meters away now. So now we need to find the smallest velocity to reach this point. One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed. Since the focus of the safety parabola is the point of launch,\n\n\n\nthe directrix is\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{1^{2}+4.15^{2}}=4.27 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\naway from the top of the hoop. The distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola is then $(4.27+1) / 2=2.63 \\mathrm{~m}$.

There is one last bit we need to check to complete this problem. The basketball's trajectory has to actually be possible (i.e. it doesn't go underneath the rim). It is clearly less optimal intuitively. If it passes through the underside, it means that its apex of the trajectory is very near its target."

        "question": "A uniform bar of length $l$ and mass $m$ is connected to a very long thread of negligible mass suspended from a ceiling.

As it falls down, the minimum tension acting on the thread over the rod's entire motion is given by $\\alpha m g$. Determine $\\alpha$.\n<img_4310>",
        "solution": [
            "First note that the thread is given to be very long. Therefore, only vertical tension and gravitational forces act on the rod allowing for its center of mass to move in a straight vertical line. Using this fact, we can now write the acceleration of the rod in terms of angular velocity $\\omega$ and angular acceleration $\\varepsilon$. Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$. Then, by defining the coordinate $y$ to be the change in vertical length of the rod where $y=l \\cos \\varphi$, one can write for varying $\\varphi \\in[\\varphi, \\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)$ that $l \\cos (\\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)=y+\\mathrm{d} y \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm{d} y=l \\sin \\varphi \\mathrm{d} \\varphi$. Thus, simple differentiation proves that\n$$\nv=l \\sin \\varphi \\omega \\Longrightarrow a=l \\varepsilon \\sin \\varphi+l \\omega^{2} \\cos \\varphi\n$$\n\nWe can now also write conservation of energy to get another relationship between velocity and angular velocity. At any given moment, it can be written that $m g l=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^{2}-m g l \\cos \\varphi$. Since $I=\\frac{1}{2} m(2 l)^{2}=\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2}$, then\n\n$$\nm g l(1+\\cos \\varphi)=m l^{2} \\omega^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sin ^{2} \\varphi+\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\n$$\n\nOur third equation comes from the fact that the tension on the rod at any moment can be written as $T=m g-m a \\Longrightarrow m a=m g-T$. We can finally get a fourth equation by equating torques such that $\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2} \\varepsilon=T l \\sin \\varphi$. With these four equations, simple algebra yields the tension at any point is\n\n$$\nT(\\varphi)=\\frac{1+(3 \\cos \\varphi-1)^{2}}{\\left(1+3 \\sin ^{2} \\varphi\\right)^{2}} m g \\Longrightarrow T_{\\min } \\approx 0.165 m g\n$$"

        "solution": [
            "We will work in the reference frame of the center of mass of the cylinder because the fluid flow is steady in this reference frame. The key intuition here is that the magnitude of the fluid velocity above the cylinder will be higher on the top because the tangential velocity of the cylinder is in the same direction as the velocity of the fluid on the top. By Bernoulli's principle, this means that the pressure on the top is lower than the pressure on the bottom, which will create a lift force on the cylinder.\nWith the given theory, we can model this quantitatively. In our chosen reference frame, the water\n\n\n\nmoves with velocity $v$ to the left.

Furthermore, on the surface of the cylinder, we have the tangential velocity of the fluid is $2 v \\sin \\theta+R \\omega$ in the counterclockwise direction. Consider points on the cylinder at angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$. By Bernoulli's principle (ignoring the height difference which will be accounted with the buoyant force),\n\n$$\np_{-\\theta}-p_{\\theta}=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho\\left((2 v \\sin \\theta+R \\omega)^{2}-(-2 v \\sin \\theta+R \\omega)^{2}\\right)=4 \\rho v R \\omega \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nIf we integrate this result along the surface of the cylinder, we can find the lift force per unit length.

        "question": "Consider a rectangular loop made of superconducting material with length $\\ell=200 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and width $w=2 \\mathrm{~cm}$. The radius of this particular wire is $r=0.5 \\mathrm{~mm}$. This superconducting rectangular loop initially has a current $I_{1}=5 \\mathrm{~A}$ in the counterclockwise direction as shown in the figure below. This rectangular loop is situated a distance $d=1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ above an infinitely long wire that initially contains no current. Suppose that the current in the infinitely long wire is increased to some current $I_{2}$ such that there is an attractive force $F$ between the rectangular loop and the long wire. Find the maximum possible value of $F$. Write your answer in newtons.\nHint: You may neglect the magnetic field produced by the vertical segments in the rectangular loop.\n\n<img_4258>",
        "solution": [
            "The key idea is that the superconducting loop must have constant flux. If it did not, by Faraday's Law, an emf\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}=-\\frac{d \\Phi}{d t}\n$$\n\nwould be generated in the loop. Since superconducting materials have no resistance, this would imply an infinite current, hence a contradiction.\n\nWe will first compute the flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$. Since $w \\ll \\ell$, we can assume that the vertical segments produce negligible amounts of magnetic field. We can furthermore approximate the field produced by one of the horizontal wires a distance $r$ away as\n\n\n\n$\\frac{\\mu_{0} I}{2 \\pi r}$ (this is valid for an infinitely long wire, and therefore is also valid in the regime where $w \\ll \\ell$ ).\n\nThus, the total flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{1}=\\int_{r}^{w} B\\left(\\ell d r^{\\prime}\\right)=\\int_{r}^{w-r}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\pi r^{\\prime}}+\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\pi\\left(w-r^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right) \\ell d r^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{1} \\ell}{\\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that the self inductance of the loop is $L=\\frac{\\Phi}{I_{1}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell}{\\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we will determine the flux through the rectangular loop due to the long current-carrying wire. This is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{2}=\\int_{d}^{d+w} \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\pi r}(\\ell d r)=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2} \\ell}{2 \\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{d+w}{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe mutual inductance is $M=\\frac{\\Phi_{2}}{I_{2}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell}{2 \\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{d+w}{d}\\right)$. In to maintain the same flux in the loop, the current will change to $I_{3}$ where\n\n$$\nL I_{1}=M I_{2}+L I_{3}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nI_{3}=I_{1}-\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the force between the rectangular loop and the long, current-carrying wire. The forces on the vertical sides cancel out because the current in the loop is in opposite directions on these sides. From the horizontal sides, we have the force is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF=\\sum\\left(I_{3} \\vec{\\ell} \\times \\vec{B}\\right) & =I_{3} \\ell\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\pi d}-\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\pi(d+w)}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell w}{2 \\pi d(d+w)}\\left[I_{2}\\left(I_{1}-\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\right)\\right] .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis quadratic in $I_{2}$ is maximized when $I_{2}=\\frac{L}{2 M} I_{1}$ in which case the force becomes\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell w}{2 \\pi d(d+w)} \\frac{L I_{1}^{2}}{4 M}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell w I_{1}^{2}}{4 \\pi d(d+w)} \\frac{\\ln \\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)}{\\ln \\left(\\frac{d+w}{d}\\right)}\n$$\n\nNote: If the size of the wires is considered when computing flux, a slightly different answer is obtained. In the contest, all answers between $1.11 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $1.18 \\times 10^{-3}$ were accepted."

It is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}=\\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the surrounding fluid, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is a reference length parameter that varies based on each object.

Due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, empirical data is commonly used, as depicted in the figure provided above. Notably, the figure indicates a significant decrease in the drag coefficient around $\\operatorname{Re} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{5}$.

        "question": "Two carts, each with a mass of $300 \\mathrm{~g}$, are fixed to move on a horizontal track. As shown in the figure, the first cart has a strong, tiny permanent magnet of dipole moment $0.5 \\mathrm{~A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ attached to it, which is aligned along the axis of the track pointing toward the other cart. On the second cart, a copper tube of radius $7 \\mathrm{~mm}$, thickness $0.5 \\mathrm{~mm}$, resistivity $1.73 \\cdot 10^{-8} \\Omega$, and length $30 \\mathrm{~cm}$ is attached. The masses of the magnet and coil are negligible compared to the mass of the carts. At the moment its magnet enters through the right end of the copper tube, the velocity of the first cart is $0.3 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ and the distance between the two ends of each cart is $50 \\mathrm{~cm}$, find the minimum distance achieved between the two ends of the carts in centimeters. While on the track, the carts experience an effective coefficient of static friction (i.e., what it would be as if they did not have wheels) of 0.01 . Neglect the self-inductance of the copper tube.\n<img_4305>\n\nA picture of the two cart setup.

        "solution": [
            "We analyze the thin $\\mathrm{dz}$ of copper which center is at distance $\\mathrm{z}$ away from the magnet. Notice that\n\n\n\nthe thickness of the copper tube $(w=0.5 \\mathrm{~mm})$ is much smaller than its radius. Thus, we may model the copper tube as an infinitesimally thin current loop of radius $a_{0}=a+(w / 2)$ (note that $\\frac{w}{2 a}$ is significant!) with resistance $\\rho \\frac{2 \\pi a_{0}}{w d z}$ where $a=7 \\mathrm{~mm}$. Using the formula for the magnetic field due to the dipole moment, it can be found that the B-field along the current loop is:\n$$\nB=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mu}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\left(2 z^{2}-r^{2}\\right) \\hat{z}+3 r z \\hat{r}}{\\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5 / 2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{z}$ is the unit vector parallel to the direction of motion of the magnet and $\\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing radially outward from the center of the current loop. The flux through the loop is then:\n$$\n\\Phi_{B}=\\int_{0}^{a_{0}} B_{z}(2 \\pi r) d r=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{0} \\mu \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{\\left(z^{2}+a_{0}^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\n$$\nin which Lenz law can be used to get the current of the loop, using the fact $v=-\\frac{d z}{d t}$, where $v$ is the relative velocity of the right cart to the left.\n$$\nI=-\\frac{d \\Phi_{B}}{d t}\\left(\\rho \\frac{2 \\pi a_{0}}{w d z}\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{3 \\mu_{0} \\mu}{4 \\pi} \\frac{a_{0} w v z d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5 / 2}}\n$$\nThe lorentz force on the current loop due to the magnet then obeys:\n$$\nF=I\\left(2 \\pi a_{0}\\right) B_{r} \\hat{z}=\\frac{9}{8 \\pi} \\mu_{0}^{2} \\mu^{2} \\frac{a_{0}^{3} w v z^{2} d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5}} \\hat{z}\n$$\nwhich is repulsive as expected. By Newton's third law, the force on the magnet due to the current in the copper tube is:\n$$\nF=-\\frac{9}{8 \\pi \\rho} \\mu_{0}^{2} \\mu^{2} a_{0}^{3} w v \\int_{-x}^{L-x} \\frac{z^{2} d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5}} \\hat{z}\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the depth of the magnet into the copper tube. However, when $x, L-x>>a_{0}$,\n$$\n\\int_{-x}^{L-x} \\frac{z^{2} d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5}} \\hat{z} \\approx \\frac{a_{0}^{3}}{a_{0}^{10}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{2} d u}{\\left(1+u^{2}\\right)^{5}}=\\frac{5 \\pi}{128 a_{0}^{7}}\n$$\nTherefore, for as long as the magnet is sufficiently within the tube, the force is instead:\n$$\nF=-\\frac{45}{1024 \\rho a_{0}^{4}} \\mu_{0}^{2} \\mu^{2} w v \\hat{z}=-\\gamma v \\hat{z}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma=0.1815 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe velocity of the second cart starts moving when $F>\\mu_{s} M g$ with $\\mu_{s}=0.01$ and $M=0.3 \\mathrm{~kg}$. It turns out that $\\frac{0.01 \\mathrm{Mg}}{\\gamma v_{0}} \\approx 0.5$, so this static friction is overcome very quickly. Once both carts are in motion, and since there is no kinetic friction, momentum is in fact conserved! As we'll see soon, this results in the carts performing an (infinitely-long) perfectly inelastic collision. In addition, it allows us to use a reduced mass of $M_{\\text {red }}=M / 2$ to calculate the closest distance achieved between the two carts. While $x>>a$ is obeyed:\n$$\n-\\gamma v_{r e l}=\\frac{1}{2} M \\frac{d v_{r e l}}{d t}\n$$\ngiving:\n$$\nv_{r e l}=v_{0} e^{-\\frac{2 \\gamma}{M} t}\n$$\n\nin which $v_{r e l}$ goes to 0 as $t$ goes to $\\infty$, resulting in a perfectly inelastic collision. Since $v_{r e l}=-\\frac{d x}{d t}$\n$$\nx_{\\min }=x_{0}-\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_{r e l} d t=x_{0}-\\frac{m v_{0}}{2 \\gamma}=0.252 m\n$$"

        "question": "Field-drive is a locomotion mechanism that is analogous to general relativistic warp-drive. In this mechanism, an active particle continuously climbs up the field-gradient generated by its own influence on the environment so that the particle can bootstrap itself into a constant non-zero velocity motion. Consider a field-drive in one-dimensional (the $\\mathrm{O} x$ axis) environment, where the position of the particle at time $t$ is given by $X(t)$ and its instantaneous velocity follows from:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} X(t)=\\left.\\kappa \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} R(x, t)\\right|_{x=X(t)}\n$$\nin which $\\kappa$ is called the guiding coefficient and $R(x, t)$ is the field-value in this space. Note that, the operation ... $\\left.\\right|_{x=X(t)}$ means you have to calculate the part in ... first, then replace $x$ with $X(t)$. For a biological example, the active particle can be a cell, the field can be the nutrient concentration, and the strategy of climbing up the gradient can be chemotaxis. The cell consumes the nutrient and also responses to the local nutrient concentration, biasing its movement toward the direction where the concentration increases the most. If the nutrient is not diffusive and always recovers locally (e.g. a surface secretion) to the value which we defined to be 0 , then its dynamics can usually be approximated by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} R(x, t)=-\\frac{1}{\\tau} R(x, t)-\\gamma \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{[x-X(t)]^{2}}{2 \\lambda^{2}}\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the timescale of recovery, $\\gamma$ is the consumption, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic radius of influence. Before we inoculate the cell into the environment, $R=0$ everywhere at any time.

        "question": "(d) Now, consider the effects of gravity. Given a rocket of mass $m_{0}$ and mass ejection rate $\\mu$, what ejection speed $u$ would be required to launch satellites in the Earth's gravitational field, of strength $g$ ? (An estimate, ignoring numerical factors, is acceptable.) What about launching space probes to other planets or out of the solar system? Can you guess why most rockets are multistage?",
        "solution": [
            "There are multiple ways of thinking about this problem.\n\n- (Easiest possible answer) To launch the rocket from earth we need at least the force from repulsion to be stronger than the gravity. That is $a=\\mu u / m_{0}>g$. (We get rid of numerical factors on the total mass.)\n\n\n\n- A nicer perspective: The rocket needs to get to gain enough mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential energy) from the repulsion process. It is known (from multiple ways) that the energy of an object with mass $m_{0}$ orbiting a planet in a orbit whose length of the semimajor axis is $a$ is $-G M m_{0} / 2 a=-g R^{2} m_{0} / 2 a$, where $R$ is the radius of the planet ( $G M$ the standard gravitational parameter). Therefore, the minimum energy is at $a=R$ ( $a$ cannot be lower), which is $-g R m_{0} / 2$. Besides that, we know that before launching, when the rocket is on the ground, its potential energy (kinetic energy being zero) is $-G M m_{0} / R=-g R m_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum mechanical energy needed is $g R m_{0} / 2$. This situation corresponds to \"launching\" the rocket horizontally. The rocket does not go high into the sky but flies right above the ground. As a result, as a not so bad approximation, the launching process is not affected much by the gravity. The kinetic energy of the rocket after its fuel used up, $m_{0} v_{f}^{2} / 2$ should be greater than $g R m_{0} / 2$. Therefore, we get a result:\n\n$$\nv_{f}^{2}>g R\n\\tag{19}\n$$\n\nAny answer that gets rid of numerical factors like $u^{2} \\geq g R$ is acceptable. If a student remember the value of the first cosmic speed of the earth: $v_{o}=\\sqrt{g R}=7.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, and states that $v_{f}$, or a multiple of $u$ (like $2.302 u$ we got above), should be greater than $v_{o}$ is also great.\n\n- For launching our rocket to other planets, we need to escape from the gravitational field of the earth. That is, the final mechanical energy of the rocket should be greater than zero:\n\n$$\nv_{f}^{2}>2 g R\n\\tag{20}\n$$\n\nIt is also great if a student remember that the escape speed of the each is $v_{e}=\\sqrt{2 g R}=11.2$ and states that a multiple of $u$ should be larger than $v_{e}$.\n\n- The reason why rockets are multistage is that We see from previous parts that the ejection speed of the lightest fuel with $100 \\%$ energy conversion rate is only $u=5614 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the final speed $v_{f}$ of a very light rocket (mass ratio between fuel and rocket itself being 9 ) is just $\\approx 2.3 u=12.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, which is only at the same magnitude of the first cosmic speed and the escape speed.\n\nIn real world, rockets cannot be so ideal. Therefore, a single stage rocket can hardly be launched to orbit around the earth, not to mention escaping. Multistage rockets drop part of its mass to further increase the mass ratio between the remaining fuel and itself in order to make itself to the sky.\n\n"

The temperature of the crust $T$ is also constant in time but can depend on position.\n\n\n\nIt is known that, to high accuracy, the crustal material expands linearly with temperature $T$. Since water and mantle temperatures are assumed to be constant, it is convenient to use a rescaled version of the thermal expansion coefficient.

Kinetic energy of these electrons is $E=m v^{2} / 2$ ( $v$ is velocity) and they leave the source at precisely controlled moments.

The focal length of the idealized electrostatic lens: instantaneous charging\n\nOne wants to build a device to focus electrons-an electrostatic lens. Let us consider the following construction. The ring is situated perpendicularly to the $z$-axis, as shown in Figure 2. We have a source that produces on-demand packets of non-relativistic electrons. Kinetic energy of these electrons is $E=m v^{2} / 2$ ( $v$ is velocity) and they leave the source at precisely controlled moments. The system is programmed so that the ring is charge-neutral most of the time, but its charge becomes $q$ when electrons are closer than a distance $d / 2(d \\ll R)$ from the plane of the ring (shaded region in Figure 2, called \"active region\"). In part $\\mathrm{C}$ assume that charging and de-charging processes are instantaneous and the electric field \"fills the space\" instantaneously as well. One can neglect magnetic fields and assume that the velocity of electrons in the $z$-direction is constant. Moving electrons do not perturb the charge distribution on the ring.\n\n<img_4381>\n\nFigure 2. A model of an electrostatic lens.\nContext question:\nC.1 Determine the focal length $f$ of this lens. Assume that $f \\gg d$. Express your answer in terms of the constant $\\beta$ from question B. 1 and other known quantities.

The ring as a capacitor\n\nThe model of considered above was idealized and we assumed that the ring charged instantaneously. In reality charging is non-instantaneous, as the ring is a capacitor with a finite capacitance $C$. In this part we will analyze the properties of this capacitor.

When electrons pass the \"active region\", the ring is connected to the ground. The resistance of contacts is $R_{0}$ and the resistance of the ring itself can be neglected.\n\n<img_4401>\n\nFigure 3. Charging of the electrostatic lens.\nContext question:\nD.2 Determine the dependence of the charge on the ring as a function of time, $q(t)$. $t=0$ corresponds to a time moment when electrons are in the plane of the ring. What is the charge on the ring $q_{0}$ when the absolute value $q(t)$ is maximum? The capacitance of the ring is $C$ (i.e., you do not have to use the actual expression found in D.1).\n\nRemark: the drawn polarity in Figure 3 is for indicative purposes only. The sign should be chosen so that the lens is focusing.\nContext answer:\nFor $-\\frac{d}{2 v}<t<\\frac{d}{2 v}, \\quad q(t)=C V_{0}\\left(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{d}{2 v R_{0} C}} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{t}{R_{0} C}}\\right)$.\n\nFor $t>\\frac{d}{2 v}, \\quad q(t)=C V_{0}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\frac{d}{2 v R_{0} C}}-\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{d}{2 v R_{0} C}}\\right) \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{t}{R_{0} C}}$.\n\n$q_{0}=C V_{0}\\left(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{d}{v R_{0} C}}\\right) . \\quad$\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPart E. Focal length of a more realistic lens: non-instantaneous charging\n\nIn this part of the problem, we will consider the action of this more realistic lens. Here we will again neglect the width of the ring $2 a$ and will assume that electrons travel parallel to the $z$-axis before reaching the \"active region\". However, the charging of the ring is no longer instantaneous.\nContext question:\nE.1 Find the focal length $f$ of the lens.

It is divided into two regions, I and II, by a line $\\mathrm{AB}$ satisfying the equation $x=x_{1}$. The potential energy of a point particle of mass $m$ in region I is $V=0$ while it is $V=V_{0}$ in region II. The particle is sent from the origin $\\mathrm{O}$ with speed $v_{1}$ along a line making an angle $\\theta_{1}$ with the $x$-axis. It reaches point $\\mathrm{P}$ in region II traveling with speed $v_{2}$ along a line that makes an angle $\\theta_{2}$ with the $x$-axis.

The integral is taken over the path. As an example, for a particle moving with constant speed $v$ on a circular path of radius $R$, the action $A$ for one revolution will be $2 \\pi m R v$. For a particle with constant energy $E$, it can be shown that of all the possible trajectories between two fixed points, the actual trajectory is the one on which $A$ defined above is an extremum (minimum or maximum). Historically this is known as the Principle of Least Action (PLA).\nContext question:\nA.3 PLA implies that the trajectory of a particle moving between two fixed points in a region of constant <br> potential will be a straight line. Let the two fixed points $\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{P}$ in Fig. 1 have coordinates $(0,0)$ and <br> $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ respectively and the boundary point where the particle transits from region I to region II have <br> coordinates $\\left(x_{1}, \\alpha\\right)$.

The first process isasecondary electron emission, and the second one isa formation of electron avalanche. The secondary electron emission occurs when ions hit on the negative electrode, called a cathode, and the electrons are knocked out of it to move towards the positive electrode, called an anode.

The volume of gases produced per unit time in the furnace is $B$.\n\nAssume that:\n\n- the velocity of the gases in the furnace is negligibly small\n- the density of the gases (smoke) does not differ from that of the air at the same temperature and pressure; while in furnace, the gases can be treated as ideal\n- the pressure of the air changes with height in accordance with the hydrostatic law; the change of the density of the air with height is negligible\n- the flow of gases fulfills the Bernoulli equation which states that the following quantity is conserved in all points of the flow:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^{2}(z)+\\rho g z+p(z)=$ const,\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the gas, $v(z)$ is its velocity, $p(z)$ is pressure, and $z$ is the height\n\n- the change of the density of the gas is negligible throughout the chimney\n\n<img_4538>\n\nTask 1\nContext question:\na) What is the minimal height of the chimney needed in order that the chimney functions efficiently, so that it can release all of the produced gas into the atmosphere? Express your result in terms of $B, A, T_{\\text {Air, }} g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}, \\Delta T=T_{\\text {Smoke }}-T_{\\text {Air }}$.

The idea is illustrated in Fig. 2. The Sun heats the air underneath the collector of area $S$ with an open periphery to allow the undisturbed inflow of air (see Fig. 2). As the heated air rises through the chimney (thin solid arrows), new cold air enters the collector from its surrounding (thick dotted arrows) enabling a continuous flow of air through the power plant. The flow of air through the chimney powers a turbine, resulting in the production of electrical energy. The energy of solar radiation per unit time per unit of horizontal area of the collector is $G$. Assume that all that energy can be used to heat the air in the collector (the mass heat capacity of the air is $c$, and one can neglect its dependence on the air temperature). We define the efficiency of the solar chimney as the ratio of the kinetic energy of the gas flow and the solar energy absorbed in heating of the air prior to its entry into the chimney.\n\n\n\n<img_4414>\n\nTask 2\nContext question:\na) What is the efficiency of the solar chimney power plant?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\eta=\\frac{g h}{c T_{A t m}}$}\n\n\nContext question:\nb) How the efficiency of the chimney changes with its height, linear or unlinear.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{linear}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nManzanares prototype \n\nThe prototype chimney built in Manzanares, Spain, had a height of $195 \\mathrm{~m}$, and a radius $5 \\mathrm{~m}$.

Simple model of an atomic nucleus \n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough atomic nuclei are quantum objects, a number of phenomenological laws for their basic properties (like radius or binding energy) can be deduced from simple assumptions: (i) nuclei are built from nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons); (ii) strong nuclear interaction holding these nucleons together has a very short range (it acts only between neighboring nucleons); (iii) the number of protons $(Z)$ in a given nucleus is approximately equal to the number of neutrons $(N)$, i.e. $Z \\approx N \\approx A / 2$, where $A$ is the total number of nucleons $(A \\gg 1)$. Important: Use these assumptions in Tasks 1-4 below.\n\nTask 1 - Atomic nucleus as closely packed system of nucleons\n\nIn a simple model, an atomic nucleus can be thought of as a ball consisting of closely packed nucleons [see Fig. 1(a)], where the nucleons are hard balls of radius $r_{N}=0.85 \\mathrm{fm}\\left(1 \\mathrm{fm}=10^{-15} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$. The nuclear force is present only for two nucleons in contact. The volume of the nucleus $V$ is larger than the volume of all nucleons $A V_{N}$, where $V_{N}=\\frac{4}{3} r_{N}^{3} \\pi$. The ratio $f=A V_{N} / V$ is called the packing factor and gives the percentage of space filled by the nuclear matter.\n\n<img_4362>\nContext question:\na) Calculate what would be the packing factor $f$ if nucleons were arranged in a \"simple cubic\" (SC) crystal system, where each nucleon is centered on a lattice point of an infinite cubic lattice [see Fig. 1(b)].\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{\\pi}{6}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nImportant: In all subsequent tasks, assume that the actual packing factor for nuclei is equal to the one from Task 1a. If you are not able to calculate it, in subsequent tasks use $f=1 / 2$.\nContext question:\nb) Estimate the average mass density $\\rho_{m}$, charge density $\\rho_{c}$, and the radius $R$ for a nucleus having $A$ nucleons. The average mass of a nucleon is $1.67 \\cdot 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$3.40 \\cdot 10^{17}$ , $1.63 \\cdot 10^{25} $ , $1.06$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask 2 - Binding energy of atomic nuclei - volume and surface terms\nContext question:\nBinding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to disassemble it into separate nucleons and it essentially comes from the attractive nuclear force of each nucleon with its neighbors. If a given nucleon is not on the surface of the nucleus, it contributes to the total binding energy with $a_{V}=15.8$ $\\mathrm{MeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{MeV}=1.602 \\cdot 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~J}\\right)$. The contribution of one surface nucleon to the binding energy is approximately $a_{V} / 2$. Express the binding energy $E_{b}$ of a nucleus with $A$ nucleons in terms of $A, a_{V}$, and $f$, and by including the surface correction.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$E_{b}=A a_{V}-3 f^{1 / 3} A^{2 / 3} a_{V}+6 f^{2 / 3} A^{1 / 3} a_{V}-4 f a_{V}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask 3 - Electrostatic (Coulomb) effects on the binding energy\n\nThe electrostatic energy of a homogeneously charged ball (with radius $R$ and total charge $Q_{0}$ ) is $U_{c}=\\frac{3 Q_{0}^{2}}{20 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}$, where $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\mathrm{C}^{2} N^{-1} m^{-2}$.\nContext question:\na) Apply this formula to get the electrostatic energy of a nucleus. In a nucleus, each proton is not acting upon itself (by Coulomb force), but only upon the rest of the protons. One can take this into account by replacing $Z^{2} \\rightarrow Z(Z-1)$ in the obtained formula.

For example, if a nucleus (with zero velocity) is in an excited state with energy $E_{\\text {exc }}$ above the ground state, its mass is $m=m_{0}+E_{e x c} / c^{2}$, where $m_{0}$ is its mass in the ground state at rest. The nuclear reaction ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}+{ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe} \\rightarrow{ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}+{ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is an example of the so-called \"transfer reactions\", in which a part of one nucleus (\"cluster\") is transferred to the other (see Fig. 3). In our example the transferred part is a ${ }^{4} \\mathrm{He}-\\mathrm{cluster}(\\alpha$-particle). The transfer reactions occur with maximum probability if the velocity of the projectile-like reaction product (in our case: ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ ) is equal both in magnitude and direction to the velocity of projectile (in our case: ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ ). The target ${ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe}$ is initially at rest. In the reaction, ${ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is excited into one of its higher-lying states. Find the excitation energy of that state (and express it units of $\\mathrm{MeV}$ ) if the kinetic energy of the projectile ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ is $50 \\mathrm{MeV}$.

            "The brute force approach would be writing down the condition that the optimal trajectory intersects with the building at two points and touches at one. This would be described by a fourth order algebraic equation and therefore, it is not realistic to accomplish such a solution within a reasonable time frame.\n\nNote that the interior of the building needs to lie inside the region where the targets can be hit with a stone thrown from the top with initial speed $v_{\\min }$. Indeed, if we can throw over the building, we can hit anything inside by lowering the throwing angle. On the other hand, the boundary of the targetable region needs to touch the building. Indeed, if there were a gap, it would be possible to hit a target just above the point where the optimal trajectory touches the building; the trajectory through that target wouldn't touch the building anywhere, hence we arrive at a contradiction.\n\nSo, with $v_{0}$ corresponding to the optimal trajectory, the targetable region touches the building; due to symmetry, overall there are two touching points (for smaller speeds, there would be four, and for larger speeds, there would be none). With the origin at the top of the building, the intersection points are defined by the following system of equations:\n\n$$\nx^{2}+z^{2}+2 z R=0, \\quad z=\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-\\frac{g x^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\n$$\n\nUpon eliminating $z$, this becomes a biquadratic equation for $x$ :\n\n$$\nx^{4}\\left(\\frac{g}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2}+x^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{4 g}+R\\right) \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{g}=0\n$$\n\nHence the speed by which the real-valued solutions disappear can be found from the condition that the discriminant vanishes:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}=2\n$$\n\nBearing in mind that due to the energy conservation law, at the ground level the squared speed is increased by $4 g R$.

        "solution": [
            "Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\pm \\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\n\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\n\n\n\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\Phi}{a^{2}}$. So, the energy density $w=\\frac{B^{2}}{2 \\mu_{0}}=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{a^{4}}$, hence\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{a^{2}}\n$$\n\nFor the two straws, we have four magnetic charges. The longitudinal (along a straw axis) forces cancel out (the diagonally positioned pairs of same-sign-charges push in opposite directions). The normal force is a superposition of the attraction due to the two pairs of opposite charges, $F_{1}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{l^{2}}$, and the repulsive forces of diagonal pairs, $F_{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{8 \\pi \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{2 l^{2}}$.

        "solution": [
            "Excess pressure inside the droplet is caused by the capillary pressure $2 \\sigma / r$ (increases the inside pressure), and by the electrostatic pressure $\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{0} E^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{0} \\varphi^{2} / r^{2}$ (decreases the pressure). So, the sign of the excess pressure will change, if $\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{0} \\varphi_{\\max }^{2} / r^{2}=2 \\sigma / r$, hence\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\max }=2 \\sqrt{\\sigma r / \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nThe expression for the electrostatic pressure used above can be derived as follows. The electrostatic force acting on a surface charge of density $\\sigma$ and surface area $S$ is given by $F=\\sigma S \\cdot \\bar{E}$, where $\\bar{E}$ is the field at the site without the field created by the surface charge element itself. Note that this force is perpendicular to the surface, so $F / S$ can be interpreted as a pressure. The surface charge gives rise to a field drop on the surface equal to $\\Delta E=\\sigma / \\varepsilon_{0}$ (which follows from the Gauss law); inside the droplet, there is no field due to the conductivity of the droplet: $\\bar{E}-\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta E=0 ;$ outside the droplet, there is field $E=\\bar{E}+\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta E$, therefore $\\bar{E}=\\frac{1}{2} E=\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta E$. Bringing everything together, we obtain the expression used above.\n\nNote that alternatively, this expression can be derived by considering a virtual displacement of a capacitor's surface and comparing the pressure work $p \\Delta V$ with the change of the electrostatic field energy $\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{0} E^{2} \\Delta V$.\n\nFinally, the answer to the question can be also derived from the requirement that the mechanical work $d A$ done for an infinitesimal droplet inflation needs to be zero. From the energy conservation law, $d W+d W_{\\mathrm{el}}=\\sigma d\\left(4 \\pi r^{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\varphi_{\\max }^{2} d C_{d}$, where the droplet's capacitance $C_{d}=4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r$; the electrical work $d W_{\\text {el }}=\\varphi_{\\max } d q=4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varphi_{\\max }^{2} d r$. Putting $d W=0$ we obtain an equation for $\\varphi_{\\max }$, which recovers the earlier result."

Somewhere inside the wooden cylinder, the wood has been replaced by a metal disk of radius $r_{2}$ and thickness $h_{2}$. The metal disk is placed in such a way that its symmetry axis $B$ is parallel to the symmetry axis $S$ of the wooden cylinder, and is placed at the same distance from the top and bottom face of the wooden cylinder.

In order to determine this distance, we design the following experiment: We place the wooden cylinder on a horizontal base in such a way that it is in a stable equilibrium. Let us now slowly incline the base by an angle $\\Theta$ (see Fig. 2). As a result of the static friction, the wooden cylinder can roll freely without sliding.

Bistable non-linear elements in biology: neuristor\n\nIn this part of the problem, we consider an application of bistable non-linear elements to modeling of biological processes. A neuron in a human brain has the following property: when excited by an external signal, it makes one single oscillation and then returns to its initial state. This feature is called excitability. Due to this property, pulses can propagate in the network of coupled neurons constituting the nerve systems. A semiconductor chip designed to mimic excitability and pulse propagation is called a neuristor (from neuron and transistor).\n\nWe attempt to model a simple neuristor using a circuit that includes the non-linear element $X$ that we investigated previously. To this end, the voltage $\\mathcal{E}$ in the circuit of Fig. 3 is decreased to the value $\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime}=$ $12.0 \\mathrm{~V}$. The oscillations stop, and the system reaches its stationary state. Then, the voltage is rapidly increased back to the value $\\mathcal{E}=15.0 \\mathrm{~V}$, and after a period of time $\\tau$ (with $\\tau<T$ ) is set again to the value $\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime}$ (see Fig. 4).

A laser beam sent from an observatory is used to measure accurately the distance between the Earth and the Moon.\n\nWith these observations, they have directly measured that the Moon is slowly receding from the Earth.

A photon can be absorbed by the atom and later spontaneously emitted; this emission can occur with equal probabilities along the $+x$ and $-x$ directions. Since the atom moves at non-relativistic speeds, $v / c \\ll 1$ (with $c$ the speed of light) keep terms up to first order in this quantity only.

This refers to the cooling of a beam of neutral atoms, typically alkaline, by counterpropagating laser beams with the same frequency. This is part of the Physics Nobel Prize awarded to S. Chu, P. Phillips and C. Cohen-Tannoudji in 1997.\n\n<img_4354>\n\nThe image above shows sodium atoms (the bright spot in the center) trapped at the intersection of three orthogonal pairs of opposing laser beams. The trapping region is called \"optical molasses\" because the dissipative optical force resembles the viscous drag on a body moving through molasses.\n\nIn this problem you will analyze the basic phenomenon of the interaction between a photon incident on an atom and the basis of the dissipative mechanism in one dimension.\n\nPART I: BASICS OF LASER COOLING\n\nConsider an atom of mass $m$ moving in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$. For simplicity, we shall consider the problem to be one-dimensional, namely, we shall ignore the $y$ and $z$ directions (see figure 1). The atom has two internal energy levels. The energy of the lowest state is considered to be zero and the energy of the excited state to be $\\hbar a_{0}$, where $\\hbar=h / 2 \\pi$. The atom is initially in the lowest state. A laser beam with frequency $a_{L}$ in the laboratory is directed in the $-x$ direction and it is incident on the atom. Quantum mechanically the laser is composed of a large number of photons, each with energy $\\hbar \\boldsymbol{c}_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$. A photon can be absorbed by the atom and later spontaneously emitted; this emission can occur with equal probabilities along the $+x$ and $-x$ directions. Since the atom moves at non-relativistic speeds, $v / c \\ll 1$ (with $c$ the speed of light) keep terms up to first order in this quantity only. Consider also $\\hbar q / m v \\ll 1$, namely, that the momentum of the atom is much larger than the\n\n\n\nmomentum of a single photon. In writing your answers, keep only corrections linear in either of the above quantities.\n\n<img_4516>\n\ninternal energy levels of the atom\n\n<img_4343>\n\nFig. 1 Sketch of an atom of mass $m$ with velocity $v$ in the $+x$ direction, colliding with a photon with energy $\\hbar c_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$.

Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above. That is, the frequency of the laser beams $a_{L}$ and $\\omega_{L}^{\\prime}$ may have any value and the absorption-emission process can still occur. These will happen with different (quantum) probabilities and, as one should expect, the maximum probability is found at the exact resonance condition. On the average, the time elapsed between a single process of absorption and emission is called the lifetime of the excited energy level of the atom and it is denoted by $\\Gamma^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a collection of $N$ atoms at rest in the laboratory frame of reference, and a\n\n\n\nlaser beam of frequency $a_{L}$ incident on them. The atoms absorb and emit continuously such that there is, on average, $N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the excited state (and therefore, $N-N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the ground state). A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result:\n\n$$\nN_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_{R}^{2}}{\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_{R}$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_{R}^{2}$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $a_{0}$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $a_{L}$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{\\text {exc }} \\Gamma$.\n\nConsider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $a_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n<img_4358>\n\nFigure 2.

Finding that the previous temperature estimate is wrong.\n\nTo check if the previous temperature estimate is reasonable, one needs an independent way of estimating the central temperature of a star. The structure of the stars is very complicated, but we can gain significant understanding making some assumptions. Stars are in equilibrium, that is, they do not expand or contract because the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward force of pressure (see Figure 2). For a slab of gas the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium at a given distance $r$ from the center of the star, is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta r}=-\\frac{G M_{r} \\rho_{r}}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $P$ is the pressure of the gas, $G$ the gravitational constant, $M_{r}$ the mass of the star within a sphere of radius $r$, and $\\rho_{r}$ is the density of the gas in the slab.\n\n\n\n<img_4408>\n\nFigure 2. The stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, with the pressure difference balancing gravity.\n\nAn order of magnitude estimate of the central temperature of the star can be obtained with values of the parameters at the center and at the surface of the star, making the following approximations:\n\n$\\Delta P=P_{o}-P_{c}$,\n\nwhere $P_{c}$ and $P_{o}$ are the pressures at the center and surface of the star, respectively.\n\nSince $P_{c} \\gg P_{o}$, we can assume that\n\n$\\Delta P=-P_{c}$.\n\nWithin the same approximation, we can write\n\n$\\Delta r \\approx R$,\n\nwhere $R$ is the total radius of the star, and\n\n$M_{r} \\approx M_{R}=M$,\n\nwith $M$ the total mass of the star.\n\nThe density may be approximated by its value at the center,\n\n$\\rho_{r}=\\rho_{c}$.\n\nYou can assume that the pressure is that of an ideal gas.",

However, to bring them together they have to overcome first the repulsive action of Coulomb's force.

        "context": "The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

The momentary energy density of the electric field is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{0} E^{2}$. The time-averaged energy density of the electric and magnetic fields are equal.\nContext question:\nB.3 Let us denote the time-averaged radiation energy flux density by $I(z)$ (average radiation power flow per unit area).

(D) denotes the stack.\n\nTo analyze the effect of the thermal contact between the plate stack and the gas on the sound waves in the tube, make the following assumptions:\n\n- As in the previous part, all changes to the thermodynamic properties are small compared to the unperturbed values.\n- The system operates in the fundamental standing-wave mode of the longest possible wavelength. It is only slightly modified by the presence of the plate stack.\n- The stack is much shorter than the wavelength $\\ell \\ll \\lambda_{\\max }$, and can be positioned far enough from both displacement and pressure nodes, so that the displacement $u(x, t) \\approx u\\left(x_{0}, t\\right)$ and the pressure $p(x, t) \\approx p\\left(x_{0}, t\\right)$ may be considered uniform over the entire length of the stack.\n- We may neglect any edge effects, caused by the parcels moving in and out of the stack.\n- The temperature difference between the ends of the plate stack, i.e. between the hot and the cold reservoirs, is small compared to the absolute temperature: $\\tau \\ll T_{0}$.\n- Heat conduction through the stack, through the gas, and along the tube are all negligible. The only significant sources of heat transfer are convection due to the motion of the gas and conduction between the gas and the stack.\nContext question:\nB.1 Consider a specific parcel of gas in the region of the stack, originally at $x_{0}=L / 4 .$ As the parcel moves within the stack, the local temperature of the nearby part of the stack changes as follows:\n\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{env}}(t)=T_{0}-T_{\\mathrm{st}} \\cos (\\omega t)\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nExpress $T_{\\mathrm{st}}$ in terms of $a, \\tau$ and $\\ell$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{a \\tau}{\\ell \\sqrt{2}}$}\n\n\nContext question:\nB.2 Above which critical temperature difference $\\tau_{\\text {cr }}$ will the gas be conveying heat from the hot reservoir to the cold one?

We will see how this generates work.\n\nLet the heat flux into the parcel from the stack be proportional to the temperature difference between the parcel and the neighboring element of the stack, given approximately by $\\frac{d Q}{d t}=-\\beta V_{0}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{st}}-T_{1}\\right) \\cos (\\omega t)$.

Assume that at the machine's operating frequencies, the change in gas temperature as a result of this heat flow is insignificant compared to both $T_{1}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{st}}$.\nContext question:\nB.4 In order to calculate work, we will consider a change to the volume of the moving parcel as a result of the thermal contact with the stack. Let us write the pressure and the volume of the parcel under the stack's influence in the form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\np=p_{0}+p_{a} \\sin (\\omega t)-p_{b} \\cos (\\omega t), \\\\\nV=V_{0}+V_{a} \\sin (\\omega t)+V_{b} \\cos (\\omega t) .\n\\end{gathered}\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nGiven $p_{a}$ and $p_{b}$, find the coefficients $V_{a}$ and $V_{b}$.

        "solution": [
            "PART B\n\nAs the liquids are in thermal contact with each other, their temperatures increase in time in the same way.\n\nAt the beginning of the heating, what corresponds to the left sloped part of the diagram, no evaporation can occur. The free evaporation from the upper surface of the liquid B cannot occur - it is impossible due to the layer of the non-volatile liquid $\\mathrm{C}$. The evaporation from the inside of the system is considered below.\n\n\n\nLet us consider a bubble formed in the liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ or in the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ or on the surface that separates these liquids. Such a bubble can be formed due to fluctuations or for many other reasons, which will not be analyzed here.\n\nThe bubble can get out of the system only when the pressure inside it equals to the external pressure $p_{0}$ (or when it is a little bit higher than $p_{0}$ ). Otherwise, the bubble will collapse.\n\nThe pressure inside the bubble formed in the volume of the liquid A or in the volume of the liquid B equals to the pressure of the saturated vapor of the liquid A or B, respectively. However, the pressure inside the bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids A and B is equal to the sum of the pressures of the saturated vapors of both these liquids, as then the bubble is in a contact with the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ at the same time. In the case considered the pressure inside the bubble is greater than the pressures of the saturated vapors of each of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ (at the same temperature).\n\nTherefore, when the system is heated, the pressure $p_{0}$ is reached first in the bubbles that were formed on the surface separating the liquids. Thus, the temperature $t_{1}$ corresponds to a kind of common boiling of both liquids that occurs in the region of their direct contact. The temperature $t_{1}$ is for sure lower than the boiling temperatures of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ as then the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are less then $p_{0}$ (their sum equals to $p_{0}$ and each of them is greater than zero).\n\nIn order to determine the value of $t_{1}$ with required accuracy, we can calculate the values of the sum of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B for several values of the temperature $t$ and look when one gets the value $p_{0}$.\n\nFrom the formula given in the text of the problem, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{T}+\\beta_{A}}, \\\\\n& \\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{T}+\\beta_{B}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$p_{A}+p_{B}$ equals to $p_{0}$ if\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{0}}+\\frac{p_{B}}{p_{0}}=1\n$$\n\nThus, we have to calculate the values of the following function:\n\n$$\ny(x)=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{A}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{A}}+e^{\\frac{\\alpha_{B}}{t+t_{0}}+\\beta_{B}}\n$$\n\n(where $t_{0}=273.15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and to determine the temperature $t=t_{1}$, at which $y(t)$ equals to 1 . When calculating the values of the function $y(t)$ we can divide the intervals of the temperatures $t$ by 2 (approximately) and look whether the results are greater or less than 1 .\n\nWe have:\n\n\n\nTable 1.2\n\n| $t$ | $y(t)$ |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $<1($ see Tab. 1.1$)$ |\n| $77^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $>1\\left(\\right.$ as $t_{1}$ is less than $\\left.t_{b A}\\right)$ |\n| $59^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.749<1$ |\n| $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.113>1$ |\n| $66^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.966<1$ |\n| $67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $1.001>1$ |\n| $66.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ | $0.983<1$ |\n\nTherefore, $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (with required accuracy).\n\nNow we calculate the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ at the temperature $t_{1} \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, i.e. the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ in each bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids. From the equations (1) and (2), we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{A} \\approx 0.734 p_{0}, \\\\\n& p_{B} \\approx 0.267 p_{0}, \\\\\n& \\left(p_{A}+p_{B}=1.001 p_{0} \\approx p_{0}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese pressures depend only on the temperature and, therefore, they remain constant during the motion of the bubbles through the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$. The volume of the bubbles during this motion also cannot be changed without violation of the relation $p_{A}+p_{B}=p_{0}$. It follows from the above remarks that the mass ratio of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B in each bubble is the same. This conclusion remains valid as long as both liquids are in the system. After total evaporation of one of the liquids the temperature of the system will increase again (second sloped part of the diagram). Then, however, the mass of the system remains constant until the temperature reaches the value $t_{2}$ at which the boiling of the liquid (remained in the vessel) starts. Therefore, the temperature $t_{2}$ (the higher horizontal part of the diagram) corresponds to the boiling of the liquid remained in the vessel.\n\nThe mass ratio $m_{A} / m_{B}$ of the saturated vapors of the liquids $A$ and $B$ in each bubble leaving the system at the temperature $t_{1}$ is equal to the ratio of the densities of these vapors $\\rho_{A} / \\rho_{B}$. According to the assumption 2, stating that the vapors can be treated as ideal gases, the last ratio equals to the ratio of the products of the pressures of the saturated vapors by the molecular masses:\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}}=\\frac{\\rho_{A}}{\\rho_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A} \\mu_{A}}{p_{B} \\mu_{B}}=\\frac{p_{A}}{p_{B}} \\mu\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{B}} \\approx 22.0\n$$\n\nWe see that the liquid A evaporates 22 times faster than the liquid B. The evaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid A during the \"surface boiling\" at the temperature $t_{1}$ is associated with the\n\n\n\nevaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g} / 22 \\approx 4.5 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid B. Thus, at the time $\\tau_{1}$ the vessel contains 95.5 $\\mathrm{g}$ of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ (and no liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ ). The temperature $t_{2}$ is equal to the boiling temperature of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}: t_{2}=100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$."

        "context": "WATER-POWERED RICE-POUNDING MORTAR \n\nA. Introduction\n\nRice is the main staple food of most people in Vietnam. To make white rice from paddy rice, one needs separate of the husk (a process called \"hulling\") and separate the bran layer (\"milling\"). The hilly parts of northern Vietnam are abundant with water streams, and people living there use water-powered rice-pounding mortar for bran layer separation. Figure 1 shows one of such mortars., Figure 2 shows how it works.\n\nB. Design and operation\n\n1. Design.\n\nThe rice-pounding mortar shown in Figure 1 has the following parts:\n\nThe mortar, basically a wooden container for rice.\n\nThe lever, which is a tree trunk with one larger end and one smaller end. It can rotate around a horizontal axis. A pestle is attached perpendicularly to the lever at the smaller end. The length of the pestle is such that it touches the rice in the mortar when the lever lies horizontally. The larger end of the lever is carved hollow to form a bucket. The shape of the bucket is crucial for the mortar's operation.\n\n2. Modes of operation\n\nThe mortar has two modes.\n\nWorking mode. In this mode, the mortar goes through an operation cycle illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nThe rice-pounding function comes from the work that is transferred from the pestle to the rice during stage f) of Figure 2. If, for some reason, the pestle never touches the rice, we say that the mortar is not working.\n\nRest mode with the lever lifted up. During stage c) of the operation cycle (Figure 2), as the tilt angle $\\alpha$ increases, the amount of water in the bucket decreases. At one particular moment in time, the amount of water is just enough to counterbalance the weight of the lever. Denote the tilting angle at this instant by $\\beta$. If the lever is kept at angle $\\beta$ and the initial angular velocity is zero, then the lever will remain at this position forever. This is the rest mode with the lever lifted up. The stability of this position depends on the flow rate of water into the bucket, $\\Phi$. If $\\Phi$ exceeds some value $\\Phi_{2}$, then this rest mode is stable, and the mortar cannot be in the working mode.\n\nIn other words, $\\Phi_{2}$ is the minimal flow rate for the mortar not to work.\n\n\n\n<img_4546>\n\nFigure 1\n\nA water-powered rice-pounding mortar\n\n\n\nOPERATION CYCLE OF A WATER-POWERED RICE-POUNDING MORTAR \n\n<img_4368>\nb)\n<img_4403>\n\nFigure 2 a) At the beginning there is no water in the bucket, the pestle rests on the mortar. Water flows into the bucket with a small rate, but for some time the lever remains in the horizontal position.\n\nb) At some moment the amount of water is enough to lift the lever up. Due to the tilt, water rushes to the farther side of the bucket, tilting the lever more quickly. Water starts to flow out at $\\alpha=\\alpha_{1}$.\n\nc) As the angle $\\alpha$ increases, water starts to flow out. At some particular tilt angle, $\\alpha=\\beta$, the total torque is zero.\n\nd) $\\alpha$ continues increasing, water continues to flow out until no water remains in the bucket.\n\ne) $\\alpha$ keeps increasing because of inertia. Due to the shape of the bucket, water falls into the bucket but immediately flows out. The inertial motion of the lever continues until $\\alpha$ reaches the maximal value $\\alpha_{0}$.\n\nf) With no water in the bucket, the weight of the lever pulls it back to the initial horizontal position. The pestle gives the mortar (with rice inside) a pound and a new cycle begins.\n\n\n\nC. The problem \n\nConsider a water-powered rice-pounding mortar with the following parameters (Figure 3)\n\nThe mass of the lever (including the pestle but without water) is $M=30 \\mathrm{~kg}$,\n\nThe center of mass of the lever is G.

In this problem, we make an approximation that the water surface is always horizontal.\n\n<img_4489>\n\nFigure 3 Design and dimensions of the rice-pounding mortar\n\n1.

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Most of these particles can be detected by the particle detector surrounding the collision point. For example, quarks undergo a process called hadronisation in which they become a shower of subatomic particles, called \"jet\". In addition, the high magnetic field present in the detectors allows even very energetic charged particles to curve enough for their momentum to be determined. The ATLAS detector uses a superconducting solenoid system that produces a constant and uniform 2.00 Tesla magnetic field in the inner part of the detector, surrounding the collision point. Charged particles with momenta below a certain value will be curved so strongly that they will loop repeatedly in the field and most likely not be measured. Due to its nature, the neutrino is not detected at all, as it escapes through the detector without interacting.\n\nData: Electron rest mass, $m=9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$; Elementary charge, $e=1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$;\n\nSpeed of light, $c=3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$; Vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_{0}=8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~F} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$\n\nPart A.ATLAS Detector physics\nContext question:\nA.1 Derive an expression for the cyclotron radius, $r$, of the circular trajectory of an electron acted upon by a magnetic force perpendicular to its velocity, and express that radius as a function of its kinetic energy, $K$; charge modulus, $e$; mass, $m$; and magnetic field, $B$.

It is particularly important to include the time dependent flow and to take into account the change in vessel diameter that occurs when the pressure varies during a blood pumping cycle done by the heart. Moreover, it is observed that in the larger vessels the blood pressure varies significantly during a cycle, while in the smaller vessels the amplitude of the oscillations in pressure is much smaller, and the flow is almost time independent.\n\nWhen the pressure increases in a single elastic vessel, there will be an increase in its diameter, thus permitting to store more fluid in the vessel, and to deliver it when the pressure drops.

Moreover, it is observed that in the larger vessels the blood pressure varies significantly during a cycle, while in the smaller vessels the amplitude of the oscillations in pressure is much smaller, and the flow is almost time independent.\n\nWhen the pressure increases in a single elastic vessel, there will be an increase in its diameter, thus permitting to store more fluid in the vessel, and to deliver it when the pressure drops. For this reason, the elastic behaviour of the vessel can be simulated by adding a capacitor to our initial description. Moreover, when taking into account the time dependent blood flow rate, one has to consider the inertia of the fluid, proportional to its density $\\rho=1.05 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{-3}$. This inertia can be described by an inductance in our model. In Figure 2 we represent the equivalent circuit for a single vessel in this model.

Consider decomposing the total force on the mass into radial and tangential parts. The radial part simply keeps the mass on the hemisphere; in the absence of a tangential force, the mass would travel in a great circle of radius $R$. Adding a tangential force deflects the mass away from this great circle trajectory, but doesn't change the radial force required, so the net radial force always has to be $m v^{2} / R$ inward.\n\n\n\nNote: The phrase \"total radial force\" could also validly be interpreted as the net radial force.

Here are two.\n\n\n- If we go to the rotating frame of reference, there is an outward centrifugal force that the mass experiences, pushing it down the sphere.\n\n- For the mass to go in a circle around the sphere, the spring force not only has to compensate for the gravitational force but also must provide centripetal acceleration. Therefore, the spring must get longer.\n\n\nContext question:\nii. What is the total radial force (i.e., normal to the surface of the hemisphere) on the mass at $t=0$ ?

        "solution": [
            "First we'll look for the height $H$ at which we should push to topple the domino with the least momentum. A convenient method is to look at the angular momentum in the domino because this is easy to calculate and describes rotational motion. Because the push is horizontal, the moment arm of the push (about the domino's rotational axis) is purely vertical. That means the angular momentum of the push is $p H$, where $p$ is the momentum imparted and $H$ is the height of the push. There is some minimum angular momentum $L_{\\min }$ to topple the domino, so we set $L_{\\min }=p H$. The bigger $H$, the smaller $p$, so we should choose the largest possible $H$. In other words, we should push at the very top of the domino, $H=h$. While we're on this part, note that if the push weren't constrained to be horizontal, the push could be a little bit smaller since the moment arm could be the entire diagonal of the thin edge of the domino.\n\n\n\nNext we calculate the minimum $p$ using energy. As the domino rotates, it converts kinetic energy to potential energy, so we'll calculate both. The domino's potential energy is greatest when its center of mass is directly over the contact point of the domino and the table. That height is half the diagonal of the domino, so the distance from the contact point to the center of the domino is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{t^{2}+h^{2}}$. From the push until it reaches this point, the domino's potential energy increases by\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\Delta U=\\frac{1}{2} m g\\left(\\sqrt{t^{2}+h^{2}}-h\\right)\n\n$$\n\n\n\nThen the domino topples. By conservation of energy, $\\Delta U$ is how much rotational kinetic energy the domino must have begun with.\n\n\n\nNext we find the kinetic energy using the rotational kinetic energy formula, $T=L^{2} / 2 I$. The moment of inertia of the domino about its contact point with the table is $I=\\frac{1}{3} m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find this with an integral, or if you know the moment of inertia about the center $\\left(\\frac{1}{12} m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)\\right.$ ), you can use the parallel axis theorem. We know the momentum $L=p h$, so the kinetic energy is\n\n\n\n$$\n\nT=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{L^{2}}{I}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(p h)^{2}}{(1 / 3) m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)}=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{p^{2} h^{2}}{m\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nSetting the initial kinetic energy equal to the gain in potential energy and solving for $p$,\n\n\n\n$$\n\np_{\\min }=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\frac{m}{h} \\sqrt{g\\left(\\sqrt{t^{2}+h^{2}}-h\\right)\\left(h^{2}+t^{2}\\right)}\n\n$$"

When a domino topples, it collides with the next domino in the row. Imagine this collision to be completely inelastic. What fraction of the total kinetic energy is lost in the collision of the first domino with the second domino?",
        "solution": [
            "Right after the collision, the dominoes touch at a height $\\sqrt{h^{2}-l^{2}}$ above the table. The second domino is vertical, while the first is rotated so that the angle between its leading edge and the table is $\\theta=\\arccos (l / h)$. Let the dominoes' angular velocities be $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ respectively. After the dominoes collide, they stick together. If we take the two parts of the dominoes that are in contact, they must have the same horizontal velocity component in order for the dominoes to stay in contact. For the first domino, this velocity is $\\omega_{1} h \\sin \\theta=\\omega_{1} \\sqrt{h^{2}-l^{2}}$. For the second domino it is $\\omega_{2}$ times the height of the impact point, so $\\omega_{2} \\sqrt{h^{2}-l^{2}}$. Because these velocity components must be equal, $\\omega_{1}=\\omega_{2}$.\n\n\n\nThis means the dominoes have the same angular momentum as each other, measured relative to their respective rotation axes. If we look at the collision, the forces between the dominoes are purely horizontal because the dominoes' faces are frictionless, so they only exert normal forces. The second domino is vertical, so all its normal forces are purely horizontal. These horizontal normal forces exchange angular momentum between the two dominoes. They have the same moment arm (i.e. the height of the collision), so the amount of angular momentum transferred out of the first domino is equal to the amount gained by the second domino, both measured relative to the dominoes' respective rotation axes. Because the dominoes are identical and have the same angular velocity, they have the same angular momentum. This means each domino has half as much angular momentum about its rotation axis as the first domino had just before the collision. (Note that forces from the table cannot change the angular momentum of the dominoes about their respective rotational axes because such forces have zero moment arm, so only the inter-domino forces need to be examined here.)\n\n\n\nKinetic energy scales with the square of angular momentum, so each domino has a quarter as much kinetic energy after the collision as the first domino had before it. That means the total kinetic energy after the collision is half what it was before the collision. The fraction of kinetic energy lost is one half."

            "As in part (a), we will find the highest potential energy of the system and make sure the initial kinetic energy is high enough to get the system to that point.\n\n\n\nAt any time after the collision, let us call the angle that the first domino has rotated past its point of highest potential energy $\\alpha$, and the angle that the second domino has rotated past its point of highest potential energy $\\beta$. Also, let's call the angle a domino rotates from its standing position up to its point of highest potential energy $\\phi$, so the dominoes have rotated $\\phi+\\alpha$ and $\\phi+\\beta$ respectively.\n\n\n\nThe dominoes need to be in contact. The top right corner of the first domino has moved horizontally a distance $h \\sin (\\phi+\\alpha)$ which we will approximate as $h(\\phi+\\alpha)$ using the small angle approximation. The top left corner of the second domino moves horizontally forward by $h \\sin (\\phi+\\beta)+t(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\beta))$. We ignore the cosine term as second order in the rotation angle and approximate this as $h(\\phi+\\beta)$.\n\n\n\nThe $y$-coordinate of the upper right corner of the first domino is $h(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\alpha)) \\approx h$.

These figures come from fitting a quadratic whose peak is when the center of mass is above the rotation point and which is zero when the domino is upright.

        "question": "a. Derive an expression for the force in the rod when it is horizontal, as shown at left above.",
        "solution": [
            "The motion of the rod can be decomposed as a superposition of rotation about the center of mass, and translation of the center of mass. We claim that the bead is stationary at this moment. To see this, note that the bead cannot have a vertical velocity component since it is fixed to the rod. Moreover, it cannot have a horizontal velocity component, because since the system experiences no external forces in the horizontal direction, the motion of the center of mass has no horizontal component.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the bead is stationary, and since the released gravitational potential energy is $M g R$, the speed $v$ of the ball obeys\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{2} M v^{2}=M g R \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v=\\sqrt{2 g R}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nThe motion of the system consists of a downward speed $v / 2$ of the center of mass, superposed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\non a rotation about the center of mass which gives the masses speed $v / 2$.\n\n\n\nNow consider the forces on the ball. The only horizontal force on the ball is the force in the rod, so we need to find the horizontal acceleration of the ball. Part of this is due to the centripetal force associated with the rotational motion,\n\n\n\n$$\n\nF=\\frac{M(v / 2)^{2}}{R / 2}=M g\n\n$$\n\n\n\nAnother part of the ball's acceleration is due to the acceleration of the center of mass, but this is purely vertical and hence irrelevant here. A third part is due to the angular acceleration about the center of mass, but this also is associated with a vertical acceleration of the ball and hence irrelevant. Thus the force in the rod is just a tension\n\n\n\n$$\n\nT=M g\n\n$$\n\n\n\nA common pitfall to think of the motion of the system as pure rotation about the bead, giving the incorrect answer $F=M v^{2} / R=2 M g$. The reason this is incorrect is that, while it correctly describes the instantaneous velocity, to compute the acceleration one must also account for the rate of change of the pivot point. It can be easy to miss this, because the point at which the pivot is currently located (the bead, in this case) always has zero instantaneous velocity. Yet the pivot point itself does have an instantaneous velocity, which must be accounted for. It is possible to solve the problem this way, but it's subtle.",
            "Here we present a more complicated, but more straightforward alternative. Let $x$ be the horizontal position of the bead. The position of the ball is\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\mathbf{r}=(x+R \\sin \\theta, R \\cos \\theta)\n\n$$\n\n\n\nBy conservation of momentum, the center of mass must be at the same horizontal position as it started, so\n\n\n\n$$\n\n2 x+R \\sin \\theta=0\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore, the position of the ball is\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\mathbf{r}=((R / 2) \\sin \\theta, R \\cos \\theta)\n\n$$\n\n\n\nThat is, it follows an ellipse whose major axis is twice the minor axis.\n\n\n\nDifferentiating this twice, the acceleration of the ball is\n\n\n\n$$\n\na_{x}=\\frac{R}{2}\\left(\\alpha \\cos \\theta-\\omega^{2} \\sin \\theta\\right), \\quad a_{y}=-R\\left(\\alpha \\sin \\theta+\\omega^{2} \\cos \\theta\\right)\n\n$$\n\n\n\nIn this case, $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$ and we are only interested in $a_{x}$, giving\n\n\n\n$$\n\na_{x}=-\\frac{R \\omega^{2}}{2}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nAt this point, one needs to find $\\omega(\\theta)$ using conservation of energy. Plugging in the result from either part (c) below or the first solution above gives $a_{x}=-g$, which indicates a force of $M g$ to the left, and hence a tension in the rod. Incidentally, yet another solution is to use $F=M v^{2} / R$ where $R$ is the instantaneous radius of curvature of the ellipse, which may be computed directly.",
            "We can work in the noninertial reference frame of the bead. In this frame, the ball simply rotates around the bead, with the naive centripetal force\n\n\n\n$$\n\nF=\\frac{M v^{2}}{R}=2 M g\n\n$$\n\n\n\nHowever, since the tension accelerates the bead to the right, there is a fictitious force of magnitude $T$ pulling the ball to the left in this frame. The real tension force and the fictitious force add up to the centripetal force, so $T+T=F$, giving $T=M g$."

If the length of the loop is longer than a critical value, $L>L_{0}$, the loop can slide along the cylinder without changing its shape, otherwise the friction \"locks\" it into a place and increasing the pulling force would eventually just break the thread. Find this critical value $L_{0}$. The weight of the thread is to be neglected; the thread will not twist when being pulled.\n\nIt might be useful to know that\n\n$$\n2 \\int \\sqrt{1+x^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} x=x \\sqrt{1+x^{2}}+\\operatorname{arcsinh} x,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{arcsinh} x \\equiv \\ln \\left(x+\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}\\right)$.",

            "Fig. 1 shows the cylinder and the loop from three different angles; $P$ denotes the pulled point of the loop, while $O$ is the top point of the thread.\n<img_4369>\n\nFig. 1\n\nImagine that the side of the cylinder is cut along the generatrix $A B$ passing through point $P$, and then the side (including the loop) is unfolded as shown in Fig. 2.

Let us introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on this unfolded plane so that point $O$ is the origin, axis $z$ is parallel with the axis of cylinder and directed downwards, axis $x$ is perpendicular to $z$ (i.e. horizontal).\n\n<img_4470>\n\nFig. 2\n\nConsider the forces acting on a small piece of the thread (with horizontal projection $\\Delta x$ ) indicated with red line in both figures. These are the tensions at both ends of the small piece exerted by neighbouring parts of the thread, the normal force $\\Delta N$ and the friction force $\\Delta f$ exerted by the cylinder. On the verge of slipping, the direction of $\\Delta f$ is parallel to the $z$-axis. Since the small piece of thread is in equilibrium, the $x$-component of the tension is the same everywhere:\n\n$$\nT_{x}=\\text { const. }\n$$\n\nThe normal force $\\Delta N$ can be determined by looking at the top view of the loop in Fig. 1.

A long thin air-core solenoid is aligned with the axis of the loop ( $z$-axis). Its length is $\\ell \\gg r$, cross-sectional area is $A(\\sqrt{A} \\ll r)$, and the number of turns is $N$. The solenoid is powered by a constant current $I$ provided by an ideal current source.

        "solution": [
            "According to Newton's third law, the force acting on the solenoid is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the force acting on the loop. The latter can be obtained from Lorentz's law by summation of infinitesimal forces $\\vec{F}=J \\Delta \\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B}$ acting on the individual loop elements $\\Delta \\vec{l}$, where $J=\\mathcal{E} / R$ is the current in the loop.\n\nSince the solenoid is long and thin, the magnetic field lines inside it are directed in $+z$ direction, and escape only from the immediate vicinity of its ends. The magnetic field outside the solenoid is vortex-free and sourcefree. The same requirements are satisfied by the electric field in empty space. Hence, the magnetic field outside the solenoid can be well approximated by a field created by two magnetic poles: a North pole residing close to point $O_{1}$ and a South pole located near to $O_{2}$. The flux $\\Phi$ emerging from the North pole (and the flux entering the South pole) is the same as the flux passing through the solenoid's cross-section:\n\n$$\n\\Phi=B_{\\text {in }} A=\\mu_{0} \\frac{N I}{\\ell} A\n$$\n\nWhen the endpoint $O_{1}$ of the solenoid is placed in the loop centre $O$, the magnetic field of the other end $\\left(O_{2}\\right)$ near the loop is negligible. The field created by the North pole located at $O_{1}$ is pointing radially outwards, and its magnitude at the loop circumference is (from spherical symmetry):\n\n$$\nB(r)=\\frac{\\Phi}{4 \\pi r^{2}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{N I A}{\\ell r^{2}}\n$$\n\nNote. it is also correct to assume that the flux from the $B$-field (which carries a factor of $1 / 2$ compared to the field above at the end of the solenoid is uniformly distributed over hemisphere.\n\nThe forces acting on all elements of the loop (and also the net force) point in the $-z$ direction, which can be expected also from the same current directions (i.e. the loop and the solenoid attract each other). Hence, the reaction force acting on the solenoid points in the $+z$ direction, and its magnitude is given by:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R} \\cdot 2 \\pi r \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{N I A}{\\ell r^{2}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} N I A \\mathcal{E}}{2 \\ell R r} .\n$$\n\nWhen the endpoint $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is located at the centre of the loop, the magnetic field produced by the South pole exerts a force on the loop. Since this field is directed radially inward, the force acting on the solenoid is the same in magnitude, but opposite in direction $(-z)$ as the force calculated above:\n\n$$\nF_2 = -F_1\n$$",
            "In this solution the force acting on the solenoid is calculated, as the force acting on the magnetic pole placed at the centre of the current-carrying loop. For this we need to find an expression for the magnetic pole strength (or magnetic charge) $Q_{\\mathrm{m}}$, which is defined as the ratio of the force and the magnetic field.\n\nThe total dipole moment $m$ of the solenoid is the product of the number of turns and the dipole moment $I A$ of each turn:\n\n$$\nm=N I A .\n$$\n\nThis can be also expressed with the magnetic pole strength and the distance of the poles: $m=Q_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ell$. From this we arrive to the expression\n\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{N I A}{\\ell}=\\frac{\\Phi}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the total flux emerging from the pole (see solution I).\n\nNote. The same result can be obtained from the analogy between electrostatic and magnetostatic fields. The Coulomb force between two point charges $\\pm Q$ can be derived from the principle of virtual work. The force is the derivative of the interaction part of the field energy with respect to the distance between the charges. The force between two magnetic charges $\\pm Q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ can be also calculated this way. From the expressions of electric and magnetic energy densities we can conclude the formula of the magnetic interaction force:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nw_{E}=\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{0} E^{2} \\quad \\longleftrightarrow w_{B}=\\frac{1}{2 \\mu_{0}} B^{2}, \\\\\nF_{E}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{r^{2}} \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad F_{B}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{m}}^{2}}{r^{2}} .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nAs it can be seen, the well-known formulae known in electrostatics can be also used in magnetostatics with the substitutions $\\varepsilon_{0}^{-1} \\longleftrightarrow \\mu_{0}, E \\longleftrightarrow B, Q \\longleftrightarrow Q_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Carrying on this analogy the magnetic pole strength can be figured out:\n\n$$\nQ=\\varepsilon_{0} \\Psi \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad Q_{\\mathrm{m}}=\\frac{\\Phi}{\\mu_{0}}=\\frac{N}{\\ell} I A\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Psi$ and $\\Phi$ are the electric and magnetic flux for a closed surface containing the electric and magnetic charge, respectively.\n\nWhen endpoint $O_{1}$ of the solenoid is located at point $O$, a North pole resides at the centre of the loop. Here the magnetic field created by the loop can be expressed from Biot-Savart-law:\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {loop }}^{(\\text {at center })}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} J}{2 r}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E}}{2 R r},\n$$\n\n\n\npointing in the $+z$ direction.

When the endpoint $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is located at the center of the loop, the force acting on the South pole should be calculated, resulting a force of same magnitude, but opposite direction.",
            "Some of the magnetic field lines created by the loop enter into the near end $O_{1}$ of the solenoid; this entering flux is given by\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text {in }}=B_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at center) }} A=\\frac{\\mu_{0} J}{2 r} A=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} A}{2 R r} .\n$$\n\nSince the end $O_{2}$ is far from the loop, the flux created by the loop escaping there is negligibly small. This means that almost all the flux $\\Phi_{\\text {in }}$ escapes from the solenoid through its side.\n\nDenote the radial component of the magnetic field vector produced by the current-carrying loop at the perimeter of the $i$ th turn of the solenoid by $B_{i}$. Only this component contributes to the net force acting on the solenoid, as the axial component produces a radial force which is cancelled due to rotational symmetry. The axial force acting on the $i$ th turn of the solenoid is given by\n\n$$\nF_{1, i}=2 \\sqrt{A \\pi} I B_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $2 \\sqrt{A \\pi}$ is the circumference of one turn, and the force points in the $+z$ direction. Summing up both sides gives the net force:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\sum_{i} F_{i}=\\sum_{i} 2 \\sqrt{A \\pi} I B_{i}\n$$\n\nTake out the factor $I$ from the summation and insert 1 written in the unusual way $(\\ell / N) \\cdot(N / \\ell)$ :\n\n$$\nF_{1}=I \\frac{N}{\\ell} \\sum_{i} 2 \\sqrt{A \\pi} \\frac{\\ell}{N} B_{i}\n$$\n\nThe sum on the right hand side is the flux escaping through the side of the solenoid, which equals $\\Phi_{i n}$, so the force:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=I \\frac{N}{\\ell} \\Phi_{\\text {in }}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} A N I}{2 R r \\ell}\n$$",

One recurring solution of this type is to divide the solenoid into small segments of length $\\mathrm{d} z$, compute the $B$-field in $z$-direction effected by current-loop from Biot-Savart, use Gauss law to relate the radial $B$ flux through the segment to $\\mathrm{d} B / \\mathrm{d} z$. compute the force on the segment using Lorentz forces and integrate the force over the length of the solenoid. In this case the marking scheme is adapted in the second aspect, awarding $0.5 \\mathrm{p}$ for the idea of using Gauss law to find radial $B$-field",
            "In this solution we relate the force acting on the solenoid to the change in energy of the system. Investigate the case when point $O_{1}$ is located at $O$ first. Due to the same current directions, the magnetic force $\\vec{F}_{1}$ acting on the solenoid points in direction $+z$. While keeping the solenoid in equilibrium with external force $-\\vec{F}_{1}$, let it move by a small displacement $\\delta z$ in the positive $z$ direction. The work done by the external force is equal to the change in energy of the system:\n\n$$\n-\\vec{F}_{1} \\cdot \\delta \\vec{z}=-F_{1} \\delta z=\\delta E_{\\text {total }}\n$$\n\nWe should be aware of the fact that the system is not closed: there is also a battery and a current source included in the circuits. Hence, $\\delta E_{\\text {total }}$ contains the change in field energy and the change of energy of the power sources:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {total }}=\\delta E_{\\text {field }}+\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}\n$$\n\nSince the force does not depend on what kind of power supplies we have, let us replace the battery with a current source providing constant current $J=\\mathcal{E} / R$.\n\nNow we find a relation between $\\delta E_{\\text {field }}$ and $\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}$ The energy stored in the field can be expressed as\n\n$$\nE_{\\text {field }}=\\frac{1}{2} L_{1} I^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} L_{2} J^{2}+L_{12} I J\n$$\n\nwhere $L_{1}$ is the inductance of the solenoid, $L_{2}$ is that of the loop and $L_{12}$ is the mutual inductance of the system. Upon small displacement $\\delta z$, only the last term changes, so\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {field }}=\\delta L_{12} \\cdot I J\n$$\n\nThe small displacement results in a change of the flux enclosed by the loop and the solenoid. The flux created by the solenoid on the loop is $L_{12} I$, and the flux created by the loop through the solenoid is $L_{21} J=L_{12} J$ (here we used the symmetry property of mutual inductance). During the short time $\\delta t$ of the displacement $\\delta z$, the e.m.f. induced in the loop ( $\\left.V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {loop }}\\right)$ and the solenoid $\\left(V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {solenoid }}\\right)$ can be expressed with Faraday's law:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {loop }}=-\\frac{\\delta L_{12}}{\\delta t} I, \\quad V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {solenoid }}=-\\frac{\\delta L_{12}}{\\delta t} J .\n$$\n\nIn order to keep the current in the circuits constant, the current sources need to provide an additional power, so they give away extra energy (in addition to Joule heat). This energy change of the sources is given by:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}=\\left(V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {loop }} J+V_{\\text {ind }}^{\\text {solenoid }} I\\right) \\delta t\n$$\n\nUsing the previous results we finally get:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {sources }}=-2 \\delta L_{12} I J=-2 \\delta E_{\\text {field }}\n$$\n\nwhich means $\\delta E_{\\text {total }}=-\\delta E_{\\text {field }}$, and hence $F_{1} \\delta z=$ $\\delta E_{\\text {field }}=\\delta L_{12} I J$.\n\nNote 1. Naively, one might think that we get the result $\\delta E_{\\text {total }}=\\delta E_{\\text {field }}$ if we imagine superconducting wires without power supplies. One can show with detailed calculation that in that case the currents in the loop and the coil change, as the total flux enclosed by a superconducting circuit must remain constant. The correct physical justification of the appearing negative sign is an important part of the solution.\n\nNow we calculate the change in mutual inductance $\\delta L_{12}$. The small displacement $\\delta z$ can be imagined as we take a short segment from the tail $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of the coil (consisting of $N \\delta z / \\ell$ turns) and move it to the head $O_{1}$. As a result, the flux produced by the loop on the solenoid increases by\n\n$$\n\\delta \\Phi_{12}=\\delta L_{21} J=\\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu_{0} J}{2 r}}_{\\substack{\\text { (at center) } \\\\ \\text { loop }}} A \\frac{N}{\\ell} \\delta z\n$$\n\nFrom this we get:\n\n$$\nF_{1}=\\frac{\\delta L_{12} I J}{\\delta z}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mathcal{E} N A I}{2 \\ell R r}\n$$\n\nIf the tail $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of the solenoid is located at point $O$, the coefficient of mutual inductance decreases upon small displacement, which results in $\\vec{F}_{2}=-\\vec{F}_{1}$.\n\nNote 2. The field energy can be also calculated from the energy density integrated for the whole space. Instead of calculating the total field energy, it is easier to find its change using the same idea presented above, i.e. take a segment of length $\\delta z$ from the tail and move it to the head of the solenoid. Assuming $\\ell \\gg \\delta z \\gg \\sqrt{A}$, the field created by the solenoid inside that segment is $\\mu_{0} N I / \\ell$ (because the field differs from this only at distance $\\sim \\sqrt{A}$ from the ends). At the end we get the same result for the change in field energy using the expression:\n\n$$\n\\delta E_{\\text {field }}=\\frac{1}{2 \\mu_{0}}\\left[\\left(B_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at centre) }}+B_{\\text {sol }}\\right)^{2}-\\left(B_{\\text {loop }}^{\\text {(at centre) })}\\right)^{2}-B_{\\text {sol }}^{2}\\right] A \\delta z .\n$$\n\nNote 3. A third possibility is to calculate the potential energy change of the displaced few turns of the solenoid.

Consider a point $Q$ on the end of the thread being pulled that coincided with $P$ at the moment when it touched the cylinder. Consider motion of the thread in a system of reference (SR), which rotates at angular speed $\\omega=u / R$ around the center of the cylinder. In that SR the part of the thread in contact with the cylinder is at rest and the point $Q$ rotates around the cylinder with the angular velocity $\\omega_{Q}=-\\omega$ (see the figure).\nSince the middle part of the thread is at rest, energy of the mass $P$ is conserved. For the same reason, the velocity $v_{P}$ of $P$ is perpendicular to the thread. Therefore the kinetic energy acquired by the mass in the rotating frame is equal to the decrease of its centrifugal potential energy:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{P}^{2}=-\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} R^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} r^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^{2} l_{P}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $l_{P}$ is the length of the unwound part of the thread on the side of the mass $P$ (see the figure).

        "question": "## T3: Cat eyes\n\nYou may have noticed that in darkness, when a cat is within the light beam of a headlamp, its eyes appear very bright, see the photo below (left). This phenomenon can be modelled by a lens setup, see the photo on right, and the diagram beneath the photos.\n<img_4480>\n\nThe photo on right was taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera. The light intensity at the camera sensor pixels marked by a red line (in the photo) is shown in the graph below: the log base 10 of the light intensity (measured as the number of photons caught by each pixel) is plotted against the $x$-coordinate, with the pixels' side length serving as the unit length.\n\n<img_4444>\n\nThe lens modelling cat eyes can be treated as an ideal thin lens of focal length $f=55 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and diameter $D=$ $39 \\mathrm{~mm}$; however, you should keep in mind that the given graph shows real measurement data, and the lens has certain non-ideal features. Most importantly, partial reflections of brightly lit areas from the lens surfaces may decrease the contrast: dark areas seen through the lens appear less dark than they actually are; this effect can be neglected for the camera lens, but not so for the lens serving as a model of a cat's eye.\n\nBased on the given data, estimate (with the accuracy of ca 20\\%) the distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp (which can be considered as a point source) if the distance of the camera from the paper sheet was $L=4.8 \\mathrm{~m}$.",
        "solution": [
            "When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\left(10^{3.4}\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\left(10^{4.4}\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_{0}$, see below.\n\nFrom the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_{0}$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface nor$\\mathrm{mal}$, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small\n\n\n\nangle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).\n\nThe luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\mathscr{L}_{s}$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.\n\nSmall angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{I}$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_{I}=I_{s} / k$, where $I_{s}$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_{0}$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_{S}$; according to the Newton's lens formula, $\\left(d_{S}-f\\right)\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)=$ $f^{2}$. Hence,\n\n$$\nd_{S}=f+\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{0}-f}=\\frac{d_{0} f}{\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\n$$\n\ncan be also determined.\n\nHypothesize that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot\n\n$$\nD_{I}=\\frac{D_{B S} d_{S}}{d_{0}}=\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_{0}-f}\n$$\n\nwhere the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet\n\n$$\nD_{B S}=\\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f+s} \\approx \\frac{D\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\right)}{f}\n$$\n\nand $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton's lens formula, $s=f^{2} /\\left(L-f-d_{0}\\right) \\approx f^{2} / L$, This leads us to\n\n$$\nD_{B S} \\approx D\\left(\\frac{d_{0}-f}{f}-\\frac{f}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left[1-\\frac{f^{2}}{L\\left(d_{0}-f\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\nKeeping in mind that $d_{0}-f=\\frac{d_{0} f}{d_{S}} \\approx \\frac{f^{2}}{d_{S}}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nD_{I} \\approx D\\left(1-\\frac{d_{S}}{L}\\right)=\\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{L} .\n$$\n\nThis means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_{I} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_{0}$ (and hence, $d_{S}$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the figure. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.\n\nGiven the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\left(D_{B S} / D\\right)^{2}$, or\n\n$$\n\\pm \\sqrt{k}=\\frac{1}{f}\\left(d_{0}-\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\right)=\\frac{d_{0}}{f}-\\frac{L}{L-f}\n$$\n\nIn the above equation, the \\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_{0} / f$ can be found to be $\\pm \\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{0} / f \\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_{0}$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_{0} / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_{S} \\approx 15.03 f \\approx 83 \\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_{0}-f \\ll f$.\n\nThe centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\prime}=h \\frac{d_{S}}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\theta=h^{\\prime} /\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\theta_{L}=D / L$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{L}}=\\frac{h d_{S}}{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the figure as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense's aperture $D^{\\prime}$ :\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\frac{D\\left(L-d_{S}\\right)}{d_{S}}\n$$\n\nBased on the graph, $d_{c r} \\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\approx 120 \\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\approx 30 \\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\approx 240 \\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\prime}=210 \\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm}$.\n\nRemark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\prime}$ (see the small figure).\n\nRemark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of\n\n\n\nthe lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.\n\nExplanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\uparrow$.\n\nExplanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_{0}$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\prime}=S\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$ at distance $d_{S}$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\omega^{\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\omega / \\omega^{\\prime}=\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\right)^{2}$. Then, the luminance of the image $\\mathcal{L}_{I}=\\Phi /\\left(S^{\\prime} \\omega^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Phi /(S \\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot.\n\n<img_4504>\n\n<img_4511>\n\nRemark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_{0}$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$, and therefore, the distances between the two spots' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d_{0} h /\\left(L-d_{0}\\right)}{D \\sqrt{k}}=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\Leftrightarrow h=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} D \\sqrt{k} \\frac{L-d_{0}}{d_{0}} \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm} .\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_{0}$ and $d_{S}$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\%$ down to approximately $1 \\%$ ). Even if $d_{0} \\approx f$ is assumed, the result is only deviated by approximately $7 \\%$."

Its temperature at ground level should therefore be close to $8{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFor a better estimate let us introduce a new coordinate $x$ whose origin is at the height, where the droplet is completely molten (somewhat higher than $\\left.h_{\\mathrm{B}}\\right)$, and which is oriented downwards. For the change in temperature of the droplet we then have\n\n$$\nm c_{\\text {water }} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} t}=m c_{\\text {water }} v \\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} x}=\\kappa\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right), \\tag{5}\n$$\n\nwhere the temperature of the atmosphere is given by $T(x)=T(x=0)+2.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{Ckm}^{-1} x=: T(x=0)+b x$.\nFor the difference $\\Delta T=T-T_{\\mathrm{d}}$ between the atmospheric temperature and the droplet temperature we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\Delta T}{\\mathrm{~d} x}=b-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} x}=b-\\frac{\\kappa}{m c_{\\text {water }} v} \\Delta T . \\tag{6}\n$$\n\nThis differential equation is solved by\n\n$$\n\\Delta T=b x_{0}+\\text { const } \\cdot \\exp \\left(-x / x_{0}\\right), \\tag{7}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{0}=m c_{\\text {water }} v / \\kappa$. From equation (2) we find that $\\frac{m v}{\\kappa}=\\frac{A}{L}$ such that $x_{0}=\\frac{c_{\\text {water }}}{L} A \\approx 0.063 \\mathrm{~km}$. Therefore the exponential factor in the above equation is negligible at ground level (the constant is close to $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and we arrive at a temperature difference between the droplet temperature and the atmospheric temperature at ground level of\n\n$$\n\\Delta T \\approx 0.13^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, \\quad \\text { and therefore } \\quad T_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 7.9^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\text {. } \\tag{8}\n$$\n\nAnother phenomenon, which effectively shifts atmosphere temperature as it is \"felt\" by the droplet is due to viscous dissipation. It can be estimated by equating the droplet potential energy loss rate $m g v$ to thermal power carried away by the circumfluent air $\\kappa \\Delta T^{*}$. This gives $\\Delta T^{*} \\sim m g v / \\kappa=g A / L=0.17^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. If both corrections were taken into account, then the droplet temperature before hitting the ground would again be $T_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 8.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$."

In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\n\nFigure 1 (a)\n<img_4407>\n\n\nFigure 1 (b)\n<img_4500>\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sketch of the experimental setup for the observation of the FQHE.

The field lines defining the structure of the Earth's magnetic field is similar to that of a simple bar magnet, as shown in Figure 2. The Earth's magnetic field is disturbed by the solar wind, whichis a high-speed stream of hot plasma. (The plasma is the quasi-neutralionized gas.)The plasma blows outward from the Sun and varies in intensity with the amount of surface activity on the Sun. The solar wind compresses the Earth's magnetic field. On the other hand, the Earth's magnetic field shields the Earth from much of the solar wind. When the solar wind encounters the Earth's magnetic field, it is deflected like water around the bow of a ship, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n<img_4465>\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n<img_4499>\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe curved surface at which the solar wind is first deflected is called the bow shock. The corresponding region behind the bow shock andfront of the Earth's magnetic field is called themagnetosheath. The region surroundedby the solar wind is called the magnetosphere.The Earth's magnetic field largely prevents the solar wind from enteringthe magnetosphere. The contact region between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field is named the magnetopause. The location of the magnetopause is mainly determined by the intensity and the magnetic field direction of the solar wind. When the magnetic field in the solar wind is antiparallel to the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic reconnection as shown in Figure 4 takes place at the dayside magnetopause, which allows some charged particles ofthe solar wind in the region \"A\" to move into the magnetotail \"P\" on the night side as illustrated in Figure 5.

Thus, some solar wind electrons in the region \"A\" also move towards the magnetotail in the region \" $\\mathrm{P}$ \". After the electrons arrive in the region \" $\\mathrm{P}$ \", some electrons can be accelerated to around $1 \\mathrm{keV}$. If energetic electrons drift down to the thermosphere (The altitude of the thermosphere is about $85 \\mathrm{~km}-800 \\mathrm{~km}$.), energetic electrons can collide with the neutral atoms, which could cause the neutral atoms to jump into excited states. A photon is emitted when the higher excited state of aneutral atom returnsto its lower excited state or ground state. Splendid aurora (Figure 1) is generated in the aurora oval due to photons with different wavelengths. It is found that the aurorais mainly resulted fromphotonsemittedby oxygen atoms. The energy levels in the first and second excited states relative to the ground stateare $1.96 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $4.17 \\mathrm{eV}$, respectively.

When the solar wind encounters the Earth's magnetic field, it is deflected like water around the bow of a ship, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n<img_4465>\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n<img_4499>\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe curved surface at which the solar wind is first deflected is called the bow shock. The corresponding region behind the bow shock andfront of the Earth's magnetic field is called themagnetosheath. The region surroundedby the solar wind is called the magnetosphere.The Earth's magnetic field largely prevents the solar wind from enteringthe magnetosphere. The contact region between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field is named the magnetopause. The location of the magnetopause is mainly determined by the intensity and the magnetic field direction of the solar wind. When the magnetic field in the solar wind is antiparallel to the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic reconnection as shown in Figure 4 takes place at the dayside magnetopause, which allows some charged particles ofthe solar wind in the region \"A\" to move into the magnetotail \"P\" on the night side as illustrated in Figure 5. A powerful solar wind can push the dayside magnetopause tovery close to the Earth, which could cause a high-orbit satellite (such as a geosynchronous satellite) to be fully exposed to the solar wind. The energetic particles in the solar wind could damage high-tech electronic components in a satellite.Therefore, it isimportant to study the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, which will give an answer of the aurora generation and could help us to understand the mechanism of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.\n<img_4413>\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img_4353>\n\nFigure 5\n\nNumerical values of physical constants and the Earth's dipole magnetic field:\n\nSpeed of light in vacuum: $c=2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$;\n\nPermittivity in vacuum: $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.9 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{C}^{2} /\\left(\\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\right)$;\n\nPermeability in vacuum: $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{A}^{2}$;\n\nCharge of a proton: $e=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$;\n\nMass of an electron: $m=9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$;\n\nMass of a proton: $m_{p}=1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg}$;\n\nBoltzmann's constant: $k=1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$;\n\nGravitational acceleration: $g=9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$;\n\nPlanck's constant: $h=6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$\n\nEarth's radius $R_{E}=6.4 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThe Earth's dipole magnetic field can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\vec{B}_{d}=\\frac{B_{0} R_{E}^{3}}{r^{5}}\\left[3 x z \\hat{x}-3 y z \\hat{y}+\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}-2 z^{2}\\right) \\hat{z}\\right] \\quad,\\left(r \\geq R_{E}\\right)\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $r=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}, B_{0}=3.1 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~T}$, and $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$ are the unit vectors in the $x, y, z$ directions, respectively.\n\nQuestions:\n\n(a)\nContext question:\n(i)  Before we study the motion of a charged particle in the Earth's dipole magnetic field, we first consider the motion of an electron in a uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. When the initial electron velocity $\\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field as shown in Figure 6, please calculate the electron trajectory. The electron is initially located at $(\\mathrm{x}, \\mathrm{y}, \\mathrm{z})=(0,0,0)$.\n\n<img_4525>\n\nFigure 6\nContext answer:\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nx^{2}+y^{2}=r_{c}^{2} \\\\\nz=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left|r_{c}\\right|=\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\left|\\omega_{c}\\right|}=\\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{e B}$ is the gyro radius.\n\n\nContext question:\n(ii)  Please determine the electric current of the electron motion and calculate the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}=I \\vec{A}$, where $\\stackrel{\\mathrm{I}}{A}$ is the area of the electron circular orbit and the direction of $\\vec{A}$ is determined by the right-hand rule of theelectric current.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$I=\\frac{e^{2} B}{2 \\pi m}$ , $\\vec{\\mu}=-\\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 B^{2}} \\vec{B}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(iii)  If the initial electron velocity $\\vec{v}$ is not perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field, i.e, the angle $\\theta$ between $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{v}$ is $0^{0}<\\theta<90^{\\circ}$, please give the screw pitch (the distance along the z-axis between successive orbits) of the electron trajectory.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$2 \\pi \\frac{m v}{e B} \\cos \\theta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n(b)  In the uniform background magnetic field as shown in Figure 6, theplasma density isnonuniform in $x$. For simplicity, we assume that the temperature and the distribution of the ions andelectrons are the same. Thus, the plasma pressure can be expressed as\n\n$$\np(x)=k T\\left[n_{i}(x)+n_{e}(x)\\right]=2 k T n(x)=2 k T\\left(n_{0}+\\alpha x\\right),\n$$\n\nWhere $B, T, k, n_{0}$, and $\\alpha$ are positive constants, $n_{i}(x)$ and $n_{e}(x)$ are the number densities of the ions and electrons.\nContext question:\n(i)  Please explain the generation mechanism of the electric current by a schematic drawing.\nContext answer:\n开放性回答\n\n\nContext question:\n(ii)  If both the ions and electrons have a Maxwellian distribution, the ion distribution is\n\n$f_{i}\\left(x, v_{\\perp}, v_{\\|}\\right)=n_{i}(x)\\left(\\frac{m_{i}}{2 \\pi k T}\\right)^{3 / 2} e^{-m_{i}\\left(v_{\\perp}^{2}+v_{\\|}^{2}\\right) / 2 k T}$,\n\nplease calculate the constant $\\beta$ in the magnetization $M=\\beta n(x) \\frac{k T}{B}$, where the magnetization M is the magnetic moment per unit volume.

Please apply the result from Question(b) to calculate the ratio of the diamagnetic field and the Earth's dipole magnetic field in Equation (1) at the position $\\left(x=10 \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{E}}, y=0, z=1 \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{E}}\\right)$. The plasma pressure is assumed to be $p(z)=p_{0} e^{-(z / a)^{2}}$, where $p_{0}=3 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{pa}$ and $a=2 R_{E}$. The magnetic field around this position is also assumed to be uniform. Be aware of the difference in the coordinate systemsin Questions (b) and (c). (Hint: The diamagnetic field is given by $B_{m x}=\\mu_{o} M$.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{1.0}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n(d)  From Figures 2, 3, and 5, it can be clearly seen that the Earth's magnetic fieldstrength along a magnetic field line is the largest at the poles and the smallest in the equatorial plane.Since the Earth's dipole magnetic field is axially symmetric and slowly varying along a magnetic field line, it can for simplicitybe treated as a magnetic-mirror field as shown in Figure 7.The magnetic field strength along a magnetic field line is the smallest $\\left(B_{0}\\right)$ at the point \" $\\mathrm{P}_{2}$ \" and the largest $\\left(B_{m}\\right)$ at the points \" $\\mathrm{P}_{1}$ \" and \" $\\mathrm{P}_{3}$ \". An electron with an initial velocity $\\vec{v}$ is located at the point \" $\\mathrm{P}_{2}$ \" and drifts towards the point \" $\\mathrm{P}_{3}$ \". The angle between the initial velocity $\\vec{v}$ and the magnetic field at the point $\" \\mathrm{P}_{2} \"$ is $0^{0}<\\theta<90^{\\circ}$. For the magnetic-mirror field $\\vec{B}=B_{r} \\hat{r}+B_{z} \\hat{z}$ (with $B_{r}<<B_{z}$ ), we can assume $\\frac{d B}{d z}=\\frac{d B}{d s}$, where $\\frac{d B}{d s}$ is the spatial derivative of $B$ along a magnetic field line. Since there is no evidence of the existence of magnetic monopoles, we have $\\left\\langle B_{r}\\right\\rangle=-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d B}{d z} r_{c}<<B_{z}$, where $\\left\\langle B_{r}\\right\\rangle$ is the gyro-average of $B_{r}$ and $r_{c}$ is the electron gyroradius.\n\n\n<img_4409>\n\nFigure 7\nContext question:\n(i)  Please give the gyro-averaged magnetic-field force along the magnetic field lines on an electron and show that the magnetic moment is a motion constant, i.e., $\\frac{d \\mu}{d t}=0$, based on the law of the total kinetic energy conservation.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$-\\mu \\frac{d B}{d s}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(ii)  Based on the motion constant of magnetic moment, please determine what the condition should be satisfied for the angle $\\theta$ between the initial electron velocity $\\vec{v}$ and the magnetic field at the point \" $\\mathrm{P}_{2}$ \"ifan electron will not escape from the magnetic mirror field.\nContext answer:\n$\\theta_{c r} \\geq \\arcsin \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{B_{0}}{B_{m}}}\\right)$\n\n\nContext question:\n(e)  Earth's dipole magnetic field lines (blue lines) are shown in Figure 8. The spiral trajectory of a charged particle (red curve) is assumed to be confined in the $y=0$ plane since the gradient and the curvature of the magnetic field can be ignored. If a charged particle with the mass $m$, charge $q$, and velocity $\\vec{v}$ is initially located at the equatorial position $\\left[x=6 \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{E}}, y=0, z=0\\right]$ and the angle between the electron velocity $\\vec{v}$ and the magnetic field is $\\theta$ initially, please determine what the condition should be satisfied for $\\theta$ if the charged particle arrives below $200 \\mathrm{~km}$ of its altitude at the latitude $60^{\\circ}$.\n\n<img_4471>\nFigure 8\nContext answer:\n$\\theta<2.8^{\\circ}$\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n(f) As shown in Figure 5, when magnetic reconnection takes place at the dayside magnetopause, reconnected magnetic field lines drift towards the nightside region because the solar wind flows tailward. Thus, some solar wind electrons in the region \"A\" also move towards the magnetotail in the region \" $\\mathrm{P}$ \". After the electrons arrive in the region \" $\\mathrm{P}$ \", some electrons can be accelerated to around $1 \\mathrm{keV}$. If energetic electrons drift down to the thermosphere (The altitude of the thermosphere is about $85 \\mathrm{~km}-800 \\mathrm{~km}$.), energetic electrons can collide with the neutral atoms, which could cause the neutral atoms to jump into excited states. A photon is emitted when the higher excited state of aneutral atom returnsto its lower excited state or ground state. Splendid aurora (Figure 1) is generated in the aurora oval due to photons with different wavelengths. It is found that the aurorais mainly resulted fromphotonsemittedby oxygen atoms. The energy levels in the first and second excited states relative to the ground stateare $1.96 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $4.17 \\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. The lifetimes of the two excited states of an oxygen atomare 110s and 0.8s as shown in Figure 9.\n\n<img_4475>\n\nFigure 9\nContext question:\n(i)  Please give the atmospheric density as a function of the altitude and the ratio of the oxygen density at the altitudes $\\mathrm{H}=160 \\mathrm{~km}$ and $\\mathrm{H}=220 \\mathrm{~km}$. For simplicity, we assume that the atmospheric temperature is independent of the altitude and the air is an ideal gas.\n\n( $\\rho_{0} g / P_{0}=0.13 / \\mathrm{km}$, where $\\rho_{0}$ and $P_{0}$ are the atmospheric density and pressure at sea level.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\rho_{0} e^{-\\frac{\\rho_{0} g R_{E}}{P_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{R_{E}}{r}\\right)} $}\n\n\nContext question:\n(ii) Please give the colors of auroras at the altitudes $\\mathrm{H}=160 \\mathrm{~km}$ and $\\mathrm{H}=220 \\mathrm{~km}$. (Hint: The dependence of the collision frequency of atmosphericmolecules on the atmospheric density is $v=v_{0} \\rho / \\rho_{0}$, where $v_{0} \\approx 10^{9} / \\mathrm{s}$ is the collision frequency of atmosphericmolecules at sea level.The excited oxygen atom will lose a part of its energy when it collides with other neutral molecules. )\nContext answer:\nwhen H=160km, the color is green\nwhen H=220km, the color is red\n",

Both corrections seem to be small but are very important for precise measurement of position. We will explore both corrections in this problem.\n\nFirst we will investigate the special relativistic effect on an accelerated particle. We consider two types of frame, the first one is the rest frame (called $S$ or Earth's frame), where the particle is at rest initially.

Note that this is not an accelerated frame, it is a constant velocity frame that at a particular moment has the same velocity with the accelerated particle. At that short moment, the time rate experienced by the particle is the same as the proper frame's time rate. Of course this proper frame is only good for an infinitesimally short time, and then we need to define a new proper frame afterward.

At that short moment, the time rate experienced by the particle is the same as the proper frame's time rate. Of course this proper frame is only good for an infinitesimally short time, and then we need to define a new proper frame afterward.

        "context": "Global Positioning System (GPS) is a navigation technology which uses signal from satellites to determine the position of an object (for example an airplane). However, due to the satellites high speed movement in orbit, there should be a special relativistic correction, and due to their high altitude, there should be a general relativistic correction. Both corrections seem to be small but are very important for precise measurement of position. We will explore both corrections in this problem.\n\nFirst we will investigate the special relativistic effect on an accelerated particle. We consider two types of frame, the first one is the rest frame (called $S$ or Earth's frame), where the particle is at rest initially. The other is the proper frame (called $S^{\\prime}$ ), a frame that instantaneously moves together with the accelerated particle. Note that this is not an accelerated frame, it is a constant velocity frame that at a particular moment has the same velocity with the accelerated particle. At that short moment, the time rate experienced by the particle is the same as the proper frame's time rate. Of course this proper frame is only good for an infinitesimally short time, and then we need to define a new proper frame afterward. At the beginning we synchronize the particle's clock with the clock in the rest frame by setting them to zero, $t=\\tau=0$ ( $t$ is the time in the rest frame, and $\\tau$ is the time shown by particle's clock).\n\nBy applying equivalence principle, we can obtain general relativistic effects from special relavistic results which does not involve complicated metric tensor calculations. By combining the special and general relativistic effects, we can calculate the corrections needed for a GPS (global positioning system) satellite to provide accurate positioning.\n\nSome mathematics formulas that might be useful\n\n- $\\sinh x=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}$\n- $\\cosh x=\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}$\n- $\\tanh x=\\frac{\\sinh x}{\\cosh x}$\n- $1+\\sinh ^{2} x=\\cosh ^{2} x$\n- $\\sinh (x-y)=\\sinh x \\cosh y-\\cosh x \\sinh y$\n\n\n\n- $\\int \\frac{d x}{\\left(1-x^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}+C$\n- $\\int \\frac{d x}{1-x^{2}}=\\ln \\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}}+C$\n\n\nPart A. Single Accelerated Particle \n\nConsider a particle with a rest mass $m$ under a constant and uniform force field $F$ (defined in the rest frame) pointing in the positive $x$ direction.

Flight Time \n\nThe first part has not taken into account the flight time of the information to arrive to the observer. This part is the only part in the whole problem where the flight time is considered. The particle moves as in part A.\nContext question:\n1.  At a certain moment, the time experienced by the particle is $\\tau$. What reading $t_{0}$ on a stationary clock located at $x=0$ will be observed by the particle? After a long period of time, does the observed reading $t_{0}$ approach a certain value? If so, what is the value?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nContext question:\n2.  Now consider the opposite point of view. If an observer at the initial point $(x=0)$ is observing the particle's clock when the observer's time is $t$, what is the reading of the particle's clock $\\tau_{0}$ ? After a long period of time, will this reading approach a certain value? If so, what is the value?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPart C. Minkowski Diagram\n\nIn many occasion, it is very useful to illustrate relativistic events using a diagram, called as Minkowski Diagram. To make the diagram, we just need to use Lorentz transformation between the rest frame $S$ and the moving frame $S^{\\prime}$ that move with velocity $v=\\beta c$ with respect to the rest frame.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x=\\gamma\\left(x^{\\prime}+\\beta c t^{\\prime}\\right), \\\\\n& c t=\\gamma\\left(c t^{\\prime}+\\beta x^{\\prime}\\right), \\\\\n& x^{\\prime}=\\gamma(x-\\beta c t), \\\\\n& c t^{\\prime}=\\gamma(c t-\\beta x) . \\\\\n& \\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n<img_4526>\n\nLet's choose $x$ and $c t$ as the orthogonal axes. A point $\\left(x^{\\prime}, c t^{\\prime}\\right)=(1,0)$ in the moving frame $S^{\\prime}$ has a coordinate $(x, c t)=(\\gamma, \\gamma \\beta)$ in the rest frame $S$. The line connecting this point and the origin defines the $x^{\\prime}$ axis. Another point $\\left(x^{\\prime}, c t^{\\prime}\\right)=(0,1)$ in the moving frame $S^{\\prime}$ has a coordinate $(x, c t)=(\\gamma \\beta, \\gamma)$ in the rest frame $S$. The line connecting this point and the origin defines the $c t^{\\prime}$ axis. The angle between the $x$ and $\\mathrm{x}^{\\prime}$ axis is $\\theta$, where $\\tan \\theta=\\beta$. A unit length in the moving frame $S^{\\prime}$ is equal to $\\gamma \\sqrt{1+\\beta^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta^{2}}{1-\\beta^{2}}}$ in the rest frame S.\n\nTo get a better understanding of Minkowski diagram, let us take a look at this example.

Now consider the case in part A. Plot the time ct versus the position $x$ of the particle. Draw the $x^{\\prime}$ axis and $c t^{\\prime}$ axis when $\\frac{g t}{c}=1$ in the same graph using length scale $x\\left(c^{2} / g\\right)$ and $c t\\left(c^{2} / g\\right)$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPart D. Two Accelerated Particles\n\nFor this part, we will consider two accelerated particles, both of them have the same proper acceleration $g$ in the positive $x$ direction, but the first particle starts from $x=0$, while the second particle starts from $x=L$. Remember, DO NOT consider the flight time in this part.\nContext question:\n1.  After a while, an observer in the rest frame make an observation. The first particle's clock shows time at $\\tau_{A}$. What is the reading of the second clock $\\tau_{B}$, according to the observer in the rest frame.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\tau_{B}=\\tau_{A}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n2.  Now consider the observation from the first particle's frame. At a certain moment, an observer that move together with the first particle observed that the reading of his own clock is $\\tau_{1}$.
