            "Denote by $O_{i}$ and $R_{i}$ the center and the radius of $\\gamma_{i}$, respectively. Denote also by $H$ the half-plane defined by $A C$ which contains the whole configuration. For every point $P$ in the half-plane $H$, denote by $d(P)$ the distance between $P$ and line $A C$. Furthermore, for any $r>0$, denote by $\\Omega(P, r)$ the circle with center $P$ and radius $r$.\n\nLemma 1. For every $1 \\leq i<j \\leq 3$, consider those circles $\\Omega(P, r)$ in the half-plane $H$ which are tangent to $h_{i}$ and $h_{j}$.\n\n(a) The locus of the centers of these circles is the angle bisector $\\beta_{i j}$ between $h_{i}$ and $h_{j}$.\n\n(b) There is a constant $u_{i j}$ such that $r=u_{i j} \\cdot d(P)$ for all such circles.\n\nProof. Part (a) is obvious. To prove part (b), notice that the circles which are tangent to $h_{i}$ and $h_{j}$ are homothetic with the common homothety center $B$ (see Fig. 2). Then part (b) also becomes trivial.\n\nLemma 2.

(a) Notice that the circle $\\Omega(P, r)$ is externally tangent to $\\gamma_{i}$ and internally tangent to $\\gamma_{j}$ if and only if $O_{i} P=R_{i}+r$ and $O_{j}=R_{j}-r$. Therefore, for each such circle we have\n\n$$\nO_{i} P+O_{j} P=O_{i} A+O_{j} A=O_{i} C+O_{j} C=R_{i}+R_{j} .\n$$\n\nSuch points lie on an ellipse with foci $O_{i}$ and $O_{j}$; the diameter of this ellipse is $R_{i}+R_{j}$, and it passes through the points $A$ and $C$.

The curved quadrilateral $\\mathcal{Q}_{i j}=\\overparen{V_{i, j} V_{i+1}, j} \\overparen{V_{i+1, j+1} V_{i, j+1}}$ is circumscribed if and only if $u_{i, i+1}=v_{j, j+1}$.\n\nProof. First suppose that the curved quadrilateral $\\mathcal{Q}_{i j}$ is circumscribed and $\\Omega(P, r)$ is its inscribed circle. By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 we have $r=u_{i, i+1} \\cdot d(P)$ and $r=v_{j, j+1} \\cdot d(P)$ as well. Hence, $u_{i, i+1}=v_{j, j+1}$.\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, suppose $u_{i, i+1}=v_{j, j+1}$. Let $P$ be the intersection of the angle bisector $\\beta_{i, i+1}$ and the ellipse arc $\\varepsilon_{j, j+1}$. Choose $r=u_{i, i+1} \\cdot d(P)=v_{j, j+1} \\cdot d(P)$. Then the circle $\\Omega(P, r)$ is tangent to the half lines $h_{i}$ and $h_{i+1}$ by Lemma 1 , and it is tangent to the $\\operatorname{arcs} \\gamma_{j}$ and $\\gamma_{j+1}$ by Lemma 2. Hence, the curved quadrilateral $\\mathcal{Q}_{i j}$ is circumscribed.\n\nBy Lemma 3, the statement of the problem can be reformulated to an obvious fact: If the equalities $u_{12}=v_{12}, u_{12}=v_{23}$, and $u_{23}=v_{12}$ hold, then $u_{23}=v_{23}$ holds as well."

Then quadrilateral $A H O^{\\prime} O$ is a rhombus, so $A$ and $O^{\\prime}$ are symmetric to each other with respect to $H O$.

Let $H G$ intersect $A^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}$ at $K$ and $K \\not \\equiv O$ since $A B \\neq A C$.

In the other words, $O^{\\prime} M \\cdot O^{\\prime} T=O^{\\prime} A^{\\prime 2}$.

Hence $O^{\\prime}$ must be fixed after the symmetry about the perpendicular bisector of the segment $F G$ iff $\\delta=\\varepsilon$ so we have $\\varepsilon=\\delta$ iff $\\triangle H O O^{\\prime}$ is isosceles. But $H O^{\\prime}=H^{\\prime} O=R$, and so\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=\\delta \\Longleftrightarrow O O^{\\prime}=R \\Longleftrightarrow O D=\\frac{R}{2} \\Longleftrightarrow \\cos \\angle C A B=\\frac{1}{2} \\Longleftrightarrow \\angle C A B=60^{\\circ} \\text {. }\n$$"

        "question": "A school has a row of $n$ open lockers, numbered 1 through $n$. After arriving at school one day, Josephine starts at the beginning of the row and closes every second locker until reaching the end of the row, as shown in the example below. Then on her way back, she closes every second locker that is still open. She continues in this manner along the row, until only one locker remains open. Define $f(n)$ to be the number of the last open locker. For example, if there are 15 lockers, then $f(15)=11$ as shown below:\n\n<img_3864>\nProve that there is no positive integer $n$ such that $f(n)=2005$ and there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $f(n)=f(2005)$.",
        "solution": [
            "First, we calculate $f(n)$ for $n$ from 1 to 32 , to get a feeling for what happens. We obtain $1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,9,9,11,11,9,9,11,11,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,9,9,11,11,9,9,11,11$. This will help us to establish some patterns.\n\nNext, we establish two recursive formulas for $f(n)$.\n\nFirst, from our pattern, it looks like $f(2 m)=f(2 m-1)$.\n\nWhy is this true in general?\n\nConsider a row of $2 m$ lockers.\n\nOn the first pass through, Josephine shuts all of the even numbered lockers, leaving open lockers $1,3, \\ldots, 2 m-1$.\n\nThese are exactly the same open lockers as if she had started with $2 m-1$ lockers in total. Thus, as she starts her second pass from right to left, the process will be the same now whether she started with $2 m$ lockers or $2 m-1$ lockers.\n\nTherefore, $f(2 m)=f(2 m-1)$.\n\nThis tells us that we need only focus on the values of $f(n)$ where $n$ is odd.\n\nSecondly, we show that $f(2 m-1)=2 m+1-2 f(m)$.\n\n(It is helpful to connect $n=2 m-1$ to a smaller case.)\n\nWhy is this formula true?\n\nStarting with $2 m-1$ lockers, the lockers left open after the first pass are $1,3, \\ldots, 2 m-1$, ie. $m$ lockers in total.\n\nSuppose $f(m)=p$. As Josephine begins her second pass, which is from right to left, we can think of this as being like the first pass through a row of $m$ lockers.\n\nThus, the last open locker will be the $p$ th locker, counting from the right hand end, from the list $1,3, \\ldots, 2 m-1$.\n\nThe first locker from the right is $2 m-1=2 m+1-2(1)$, the second is $2 m-3=2 m+1-2(2)$, and so on, so the $p$ th locker is $2 m+1-2 p$.\n\nTherefore, the final open locker is $2 m+1-2 p$, ie. $f(2 m-1)=2 m+1-2 p=2 m+1-2 f(m)$.\n\nUsing these two formulae repeatedly,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(4 k+1) & =f(2(2 k+1)-1) \\\\\n& =2(2 k+1)+1-2 f(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =4 k+3-2 f(2(k+1)-1) \\\\\n& =4 k+3-2(2(k+1)+1-2 f(k+1)) \\\\\n& =4 k+3-2(2 k+3-2 f(k+1)) \\\\\n& =4 f(k+1)-3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(4 k+3) & =f(2(2 k+2)-1) \\\\\n& =2(2 k+2)+1-2 f(2 k+2) \\\\\n& =4 k+5-2 f(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =4 k+5-2 f(2(k+1)-1) \\\\\n& =4 k+5-2(2(k+1)+1-2 f(k+1)) \\\\\n& =4 k+5-2(2 k+3-2 f(k+1)) \\\\\n& =4 f(k+1)-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom our initial list of values of $f(n)$, it appears as if $f(n)$ cannot leave a remainder of 5 or 7 when divided by 8 . So we use these recursive relations once more to try to establish this:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(8 l+1) & =4 f(2 l+1)-3 \\quad(\\text { since } 8 l+1=4(2 l)+1) \\\\\n& =4(2 l+3-2 f(l+1))-3 \\\\\n& =8 l+9-8 f(l+1) \\\\\n& =8(l-f(l+1))+9 \\\\\nf(8 l+3) & =4 f(2 l+1)-1 \\quad(\\text { since } 8 l+3=4(2 l)+3) \\\\\n& =4(2 l+3-2 f(l+1))-1 \\\\\n& =8 l+11-8 f(l+1) \\\\\n& =8(l-f(l+1))+11\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $f(8 l+5)=8 l+9-8 f(l+1)$ and $f(8 l+7)=8 l+11-8 f(l+1)$.\n\nTherefore, since any odd positive integer $n$ can be written as $8 l+1,8 l+3,8 l+5$ or $8 l+7$, then for any odd positive integer $n, f(n)$ is either 9 more or 11 more than a multiple of 8 . Therefore, for any odd positive integer $n, f(n)$ cannot be 2005, since 2005 is not 9 more or 11 more than a multiple of 8 .\n\nThus, for every positive integer $n, f(n) \\neq 2005$, since we only need to consider odd values of $n$.\n\nNext, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $f(n)=f(2005)$. We do this by looking at the pattern we initially created and conjecturing that\n\n$$\nf(2005)=f\\left(2005+2^{2 a}\\right)\n$$\n\nif $2^{2 a}>2005$. (We might guess this by looking at the connection between $f(1)$ and $f(3)$ with $f(5)$ and $f(7)$ and then $f(1)$ through $f(15)$ with $f(17)$ through $f(31)$. In fact, it appears to be true that $f\\left(m+2^{2 a}\\right)=f(m)$ if $2^{2 a}>m$.)\n\n\n\nUsing our formulae from above,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f\\left(2005+2^{2 a}\\right)=4 f\\left(502+2^{2 a-2}\\right)-3 \\quad\\left(2005+2^{2 a}=4\\left(501+2^{2 a-2}\\right)+1\\right) \\\\\n& =4 f\\left(501+2^{2 a-2}\\right)-3 \\\\\n& =4\\left(4 f\\left(126+2^{2 a-4}\\right)-3\\right)-3 \\quad\\left(501+2^{2 a-2}=4\\left(125+2^{2 a-4}\\right)+1\\right) \\\\\n& =16 f\\left(126+2^{2 a-4}\\right)-15 \\\\\n& =16 f\\left(125+2^{2 a-4}\\right)-15 \\\\\n& =16\\left(4 f\\left(32+2^{2 a-6}\\right)-3\\right)-15 \\\\\n& =64 f\\left(32+2^{2 a-6}\\right)-63 \\\\\n& =64 f\\left(31+2^{2 a-6}\\right)-63 \\\\\n& =64\\left(4 f\\left(8+2^{2 a-8}\\right)-1\\right)-63 \\\\\n& =256 f\\left(8+2^{2 a-8}\\right)-127 \\\\\n& =256 f\\left(7+2^{2 a-8}\\right)-127 \\\\\n& =256\\left(4 f\\left(2+2^{2 a-10}\\right)-1\\right)-127 \\quad\\left(7+2^{2 a-8}=4\\left(1+2^{2 a-10}\\right)+3\\right) \\\\\n& =1024 f\\left(2+2^{2 a-10}\\right)-383 \\\\\n& =1024 f\\left(1+2^{2 a-10}\\right)-383 \\\\\n& \\left(125+2^{2 a-4}=4\\left(31+2^{2 a-6}\\right)+1\\right) \\\\\n& \\left(31+2^{2 a-6}=4\\left(7+2^{2 a-8}\\right)+3\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(Notice that we could have removed the powers of 2 from inside the functions and used this same approach to show that $f(2005)=1024 f(1)-383=641$.)\n\nBut, $f\\left(2^{2 b}+1\\right)=1$ for every positive integer $b$.\n\nWhy is this true? We can prove this quickly by induction.\n\nFor $b=1$, we know $f(5)=1$.\n\nAssume that the result is true for $b=B-1$, for some positive integer $B \\geq 2$.\n\nThen $f\\left(2^{2 B}+1\\right)=f\\left(4\\left(2^{2 B-2}\\right)+1\\right)=4 f\\left(2^{2 B-2}+1\\right)-3=4(1)-3=1$ by our induction hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, if $a \\geq 6$, then $f\\left(1+2^{2 a-10}\\right)=f\\left(1+2^{2(a-5)}\\right)=1$ so\n\n$$\nf\\left(2005+2^{2 a}\\right)=1024(1)-383=641=f(2005)\n$$\n\nso there are infinitely many integers $n$ for which $f(n)=f(2005)$."

It helps to draw the hideout map as in the following diagram, so that odd-numbered hideouts are all on one level and even-numbered hideouts are all on another level; the case where $n$ is odd is shown below. (A similar argument applies where $n$ is even.)\n\n<img_3525>\n\n\n\nEach night, the Robber has the choice of moving diagonally left or diagonally right on this map, but he is required to move from top to bottom or vice-versa.\n\nFor the first $n-2$ days, the Cop should search hideouts $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$, in that order. For the next $n-2$ days, the Cop should search hideouts $A_{n-1}, A_{n-2}, \\ldots, A_{2}$, in that order.\n\nThe Cop always moves from top to bottom, or vice-versa, except that he searches $A_{n-1}$ two days in a row. If the Cop is lucky, the Robber chose an even-numbered hideout on the first day. In this case, the Cop and the Robber are always on the same level (top or bottom) for the first half ( $n-2$ days) of the search. The Cop is searching from left to right, and the Robber started out to the right of the Cop (or at $A_{2}$, the first hideout searched), so eventually the Robber is caught (at $A_{n-1}$, if not earlier).\n\nIf the Robber chose an odd-numbered hideout on the first day, then the Cop and Robber will be on different levels for the first half of the search, but on the same level for the second half. For the second half of the search, the Robber is to the left of the Cop (or possibly at $A_{n-1}$, which would happen if the Robber moved unwisely or if he spent day $n-2$ at hideout $A_{n}$ ). But now the Cop is searching from right to left, so again, the Cop will eventually catch the Robber.\n\nThe same strategy can be justified without using the zig-zag diagram above. Suppose that the Robber is at hideout $A_{R}$ on a given day, and the Cop searches hideout $A_{C}$. Whenever the Cop moves to the next hideout or the preceding hideout, $C$ changes by \\pm 1 , and the Robber's constraint forces $R$ to change by \\pm 1 . Thus if the Cop uses the strategy above, on each of the first $n-2$ days, either the difference $R-C$ stays the same or it decreases by 2 . If on the first day $R-C$ is even, either $R-C$ is 0 (the Robber was at $A_{2}$ and is caught immediately) or is positive (because $C=2$ and $R \\geq 4$ ). Because the difference $R-C$ is even and decreases (if at all) by 2 each day, it cannot go from positive to negative without being zero. If on the first day $R-C$ is odd, then the Robber avoids capture through day $n-2$ (because $R-C$ is still odd), but then on day $n-1, R$ changes (by \\pm 1 ) while $C$ does not. So $R-C$ is now even (and is either 0 or negative), and henceforth either remains the same or increases by 2 each day, so again, $R-C$ must be zero at some point between day $n-1$ and day $2 n-4$, inclusive."

Let $M$ be a map with at least four hideouts. The proof below shows that either $W(M)>3$ or else $M$ is a star, in which case $W(M)=2$.\n\nFirst, suppose that there are four distinct hideouts $A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$ such that $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are adjacent, as are $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$. If the Cops make fewer than four searches, then they cannot search $\\left\\{A_{1}, A_{2}\\right\\}$ twice and also search $\\left\\{B_{1}, B_{2}\\right\\}$ twice.

Then the Robber can evade capture by moving from $A_{1}$ to $A_{2}$ and back again, provided that he is lucky enough to start off at the right one. Thus\n\n\n\n$W(M)>3$ in this case. For the second case, assume that whenever $A_{1}$ is adjacent to $A_{2}$ and $B_{1}$ is adjacent to $B_{2}$, the four hideouts are not distinct. Start with two adjacent hideouts, and call them $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. Consider any hideout, say $B$, that is not one of these two. Then $B$ must be adjacent to some hideout, say $C$. By assumption, $A_{1}, A_{2}, B$, and $C$ are not distinct, so $C=A_{1}$ or $C=A_{2}$. That is, every hideout $B$ is adjacent to $A_{1}$ or to $A_{2}$.\n\nIf there are hideouts $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, distinct from $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ and from each other, such that $B_{1}$ is adjacent to $A_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ is adjacent to $A_{2}$, then it clearly violates the assumption of this case. That is, either every hideout $B$, distinct from $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, is adjacent to $A_{1}$, or every such hideout is adjacent to $A_{2}$. Without loss of generality, assume the former.\n\nBecause every hideout is adjacent to $A_{1}$ (except for $A_{1}$ itself), the foregoing proves that the map $M$ is a star. It remains to show that there are no \"extra\" edges in the map. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ are adjacent hideouts, both distinct from $A_{1}$. Because the map has at least four hideouts, choose one distinct from these three and call it $A_{2}$. Then these four hideouts violate the assumption of this case."

        "solution": [
            "Let $s_{k}$ denote the number of such unique signatures. We proceed by induction with base case $k=2$. From $8(\\mathrm{c})$, a 2-signature for a label $L$ is unique if and only if consecutive numbers in $L$ appear together in some window. Because $k=2$, the consecutive numbers must be adjacent\n\n\nin the label. The $2^{2}$-labels 1234 and 4321 satisfy this condition, ${ }^{1}$ so their $2^{1}$-signatures are unique. Thus we have shown that $s_{2} \\geq 2=2^{2^{2}-3}$, and the base case is established.\n\nNow suppose $s_{k} \\geq 2^{2^{k}-3}$ for some $k \\geq 2$. Let $L_{k}$ be a $2^{k}$-label with a unique $2^{k-1}$-signature. Write $L_{k}=\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2^{k}}\\right)$. We will expand $L_{k}$ to form a $2^{k+1}$ label by replacing each $a_{i}$ above with the numbers $2 a_{i}-1$ and $2 a_{i}$ (in some order). This process produces a valid $2^{k+1}$-label, because the numbers produced are all the integers from 1 to $2^{k+1}$. Furthermore, different $L_{k}$ 's will produce different labels: if the starting labels differ at place $i$, then the new labels will differ at places $2 i-1$ and $2 i$. Therefore, each starting label produces $2^{2^{k}}$ distinct $2^{k+1}$ labels through this process. Summarizing, each valid $2^{k}$-label can be expanded to produce $2^{2^{k}}$ distinct $2^{k+1}$-labels, none of which could be obtained by expanding any other $2^{k}$-label.\n\nIt remains to be shown that the new label has a unique $2^{k-1}$-signature. Because $L_{k}$ has a unique $2^{k-1}$-signature, for all $i \\leq 2^{k}-1$, both $i$ and $i+1$ appeared in some $2^{k-1}$-window. Therefore, there were fewer than $2^{k-1}-1$ numbers between $i$ and $i+1$. When the label is expanded, $2 i$ and $2 i-1$ are adjacent, $2 i+1$ and $2 i+2$ are adjacent, and $2 i$ and $2 i+1$ are fewer than $2 \\cdot\\left(2^{k-1}-1\\right)+2=2^{k}$ places apart. Thus, every pair of adjacent integers is within some $2^{k}$-window.\n\nSince each pair of consecutive integers in our new $2^{k+1}$-label coexists in some $2^{k}$-window for every possible such expansion of $L_{k}$, that means all $2^{2^{k}}$ ways of expanding $L_{k}$ to a $2^{k+1}$-label result in labels with unique $2^{k}$-signatures. We then get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_{k+1} & \\geq 2^{2^{k}} \\cdot s_{k} \\\\\n& \\geq 2^{2^{k}} \\cdot 2^{2^{k}-3} \\\\\n& =2^{2^{k+1}-3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich completes the induction."

These usually correspond to two distinct radii, $r_{1}=\\frac{1}{\\left|d_{1}\\right|}$ and $r_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\left|d_{2}\\right|}$.\n\nOne possible exception case to consider is if $r_{2}=r_{1}$, which would occur if $d_{2}=-d_{1}$. This case can be ruled out because $d_{1}+d_{2}=p=2(a+b+c)$, which must be positive if $a, b, c>0$. (Notice too that this inequality rules out the possibility that both circles have negative curvature, so that there cannot be two distinct circles to which the given circles are internally tangent.)\n\nWhen both roots $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ are positive, the three given circles are externally tangent to both fourth circles. When one is positive and one is negative, the three given circles are internally tangent to one circle and externally tangent to the other.\n\n\n\nWhile the foregoing answers the question posed, it is interesting to examine the result from a geometric perspective: why are there normally two possible fourth circles? Consider the case when one of $a, b$, and $c$ is negative (i.e., two circles are internally tangent to a third). Let $A$ and $B$ be circles internally tangent to $C$. Then $A$ and $B$ partition the remaining area of $C$ into two c-triangles, each of which has an incircle, providing the two solutions.\n\nIf, as in the given problem, $a, b, c>0$, then all three circles $A, B$, and $C$, are mutually externally tangent. In this case, the given circles bound a c-triangle, which has an incircle, corresponding to one of the two roots. The complementary arcs of the given circles bound an infinite region, and this region normally contains a second circle tangent to the given circles. To demonstrate this fact geometrically, consider shrink-wrapping the circles: the shrink-wrap is the border of the smallest convex region containing all three circles. (This region is called the convex hull of the circles). There are two cases to address. If only two circles are touched by the shrink-wrap, then one circle is wedged between two larger ones and completely enclosed by their common tangents. In such a case, a circle can be drawn so that it is tangent to all three circles as shown in the diagram below (shrink-wrap in bold; locations of fourth circle marked at $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ ).\n\n<img_3391>\n\nOn the other hand, if the shrink-wrap touches all three circles, then it can be expanded to make a circle tangent to and containing $A, B$, and $C$, as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3298>"
