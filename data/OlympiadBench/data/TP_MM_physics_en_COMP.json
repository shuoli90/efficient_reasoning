Bose-Einstein condensation\n\nThis part is not directly related to Parts A and B. Here, we will study the collective behaviour of bosonic particles. Bosons do not respect the Pauli exclusion principle, and-at low temperatures or high densitiesexperience a dramatic phenomenon known as the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). This is a phase transition to an intriguing collective quantum state: a large number of identical particles 'condense' into a single quantum state and start behaving as a single wave. The transition is typically reached by cooling a fixed number of particles below the critical temperature. In principle, it can also be induced by keeping the temperature fixed and driving the particle density past its critical value.\n\nWe begin by exploring the relation between the temperature and the particle density at the transition. As it turns out, estimates of their critical values can be deduced from a simple observation: Bose-Einstein condensation takes place when the de Broglie wavelength corresponding to the mean square speed of the particles is equal to the characteristic distance between the particles in a gas.\nContext question:\nC.1 Given a non-interacting gas of ${ }^{87} \\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in thermal equilibrium, write the expressions for their typical linear momentum $p$ and the typical de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ as a function of atom's mass $m$, temperature $T$ and physical constants.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$p=\\sqrt{3 m k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}$ , $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{dB}}=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3 m k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}}$}\n\n\nContext question:\nC.2 Calculate the typical distance between the particles in a gas, $\\ell$, as a function of particle density $n$. Hence deduce the critical temperature $T_{c}$ as a function of atom's mass, their density and physical constants.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\ell=n^{-1 / 3}$ , $T_{c}=\\frac{h^{2} n^{2 / 3}}{3 m k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTo realize BEC in the lab, the experimentalists have to cool gases to temperatures as low as $T_{c}=100 \\mathrm{nK}$.\nContext question:\nC.3 What is the particle density of the Rb gas $n_{c}$ if the transition takes place at such= a temperature? For the sake of comparison, calculate also the 'ordinary' particle density $n_{0}$ of an ideal gas at the standard temperature and pressure (STP), i.e. $T_{0}=300 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $p_{0}=10^{5} \\mathrm{~Pa}$. How many times is the 'ordinary' gas denser? You may assume that the mass of the atoms is equal to 87 atomic mass units $\\left(m_{\\mathrm{amu}}\\right)$.\nContext answer:\nExpression: $n_{c}=\\frac{\\left(3 \\cdot 87 m_{\\mathrm{amu}} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T_{c}\\right)^{3 / 2}}{h^{3}}$.\n\nNumerical value: $n_{c} \\approx 1.59 \\cdot 10^{18} \\mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.\n\nExpression: $n_{0}=p /\\left(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\\right)$.\n\nNumerical value: $n_{0} / n_{c} \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^{7}$.\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPart D. Three-beam optical lattices\n\nThe first Bose-Einstein condensates were produced back in 1995, and since then the experimental work has branched out in diverse directions. In this part, you will investigate one particularly fruitful idea to load the condensate into spatially periodic potentials created by interfering a number of coherent laser beams. Due to the periodic nature of the resulting interference patterns, they are referred to as optical lattices. The potential energy $V(\\vec{r})$ of an atom moving in an optical lattice is proportional to the local intensity of the light, and in your calculations you may assume that\n\n$$\nV(\\vec{r})=-\\alpha\\left\\langle|\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t)|^{2}\\right\\rangle\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\alpha$ is a positive constant, and the angle brackets indicate time-averaging which eliminates the rapidly oscillating terms. The electric field produced by the $i$-th laser is described by\n\n$$\n\\vec{E}_{i}=E_{0, i} \\vec{\\varepsilon}_{i} \\cos \\left(\\vec{k}_{i} \\cdot \\vec{r}-\\omega t\\right)\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nwith the amplitude $E_{0, i}$, the wave vector $\\vec{k}_{i}$, and the unit-length polarization vector $\\vec{\\varepsilon}_{i}$.\n\n<img_4443>\n\n(a)\n\n<img_4554>\n\n(b)\n\n<img_4345>\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2. (a) Three-beam optical lattice: three plane waves with wave vectors $\\vec{k}_{1,2,3}$ intersect and interfere in the area indicated by the grey circle. (b) Symmetries of a regular hexagon: solid and dashed lines show two sets of symmetry axes. (c) Saddle point: a point on a surface where the slopes in orthogonal directions are all zero, but which is not a local extremum of the plotted function. Travelling along the trajectory marked by the full line one encounters an apparent minimum. Additional analysis of the perpendicular direction (dashed line) is needed to distinguish a true minimum from a saddle point (shown).\n\nYour task is to study triangular optical lattices that are produced by interfering three coherent laser beams of equal intensity. A typical setup is shown in Fig. 2a. Here, all three beams are polarized in the $z$ direction, propagate in the $x y$ plane and intersect at equal angles of $120^{\\circ}$. Choose the direction of the $x$ axis parallel to the wave vector $\\vec{k}_{1}$.\nContext question:\nD.1 Using Eqs. 2 and 3 obtain the expression for the potential energy $V(\\vec{r})$ as a function of $\\vec{r}=(x, y)$ in the plane of the beams.\n\nHint: the result can be neatly expressed as a constant term plus a sum of three cosine functions of arguments $\\vec{b}_{i} \\cdot \\vec{r}$. Please write your result in this form and identify the vectors $\\vec{b}_{i}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$V(\\vec{r})=-\\alpha E_{0}^{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}+\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\cos \\vec{b}_{j} \\cdot \\vec{r}\\right)$,$\\vec{b}_{1}=\\vec{k}_{2}-\\vec{k}_{3}, \\quad \\vec{b}_{2}=\\vec{k}_{3}-\\vec{k}_{1}, \\quad \\vec{b}_{3}=\\vec{k}_{1}-\\vec{k}_{2}$}\n",

Like many other heat machines, it can be operated in reverse to become a refrigerator, using sound to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir. The high operating frequencies reduce heat conduction and eliminate the need for any working chamber confinement. Unlike many other engine types, the thermoacoustic engine has no moving parts except the working fluid itself.\n\nThe efficiencies of thermoacoustic machines are typically lower than other engine types, but they have advantages in set up and maintenance costs. This creates opportunities for renewable energy applications, such as solar-thermal power plants and utilization of waste heat. Our analysis will focus on the creation of acoustic energy within the system, ignoring the extraction or conversion for powering external devices.\n\nPart A: Sound wave in a closed tube\n\nConsider a thermally insulating tube of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $S$, whose axis lies along the $x$ direction. The two ends of the tube are located at $x=0$ and $x=L$. The tube is filled with an ideal gas and is sealed on both ends. At equilibrium, the gas has temperature $T_{0}$, pressure $p_{0}$ and mass density $\\rho_{0}$. Assume that viscosity can be ignored and that the gas motion is only in the $x$ direction.

However, due to the satellites high speed movement in orbit, there should be a special relativistic correction, and due to their high altitude, there should be a general relativistic correction. Both corrections seem to be small but are very important for precise measurement of position. We will explore both corrections in this problem.\n\nFirst we will investigate the special relativistic effect on an accelerated particle. We consider two types of frame, the first one is the rest frame (called $S$ or Earth's frame), where the particle is at rest initially. The other is the proper frame (called $S^{\\prime}$ ), a frame that instantaneously moves together with the accelerated particle. Note that this is not an accelerated frame, it is a constant velocity frame that at a particular moment has the same velocity with the accelerated particle. At that short moment, the time rate experienced by the particle is the same as the proper frame's time rate. Of course this proper frame is only good for an infinitesimally short time, and then we need to define a new proper frame afterward. At the beginning we synchronize the particle's clock with the clock in the rest frame by setting them to zero, $t=\\tau=0$ ( $t$ is the time in the rest frame, and $\\tau$ is the time shown by particle's clock).\n\nBy applying equivalence principle, we can obtain general relativistic effects from special relavistic results which does not involve complicated metric tensor calculations.
