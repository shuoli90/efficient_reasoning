Hence $f_{n+1}(x)=f_{n+1}(x-1)$ for each such $x$, so $f_{n+1}(b-1)=f_{n+1}\\left(a_{n}\\right)=-1$. Next, since $b / a_{i}$ is not the $k$ th power of an integer, we have $f_{n+1}(b)=f_{n+1}(b-1)+1=0$, thus $b=a_{n+1}$. This establishes (1).\n\n\n\nFinally, since all integers in $\\left(a_{n}, b\\right)$ are not $k$ th-power-free, we are left to prove that $b$ is $k$ th-power-free to establish (2). Otherwise, let $y>1$ be the greatest integer such that $y^{k} \\mid b$; then $b / y^{k}$ is $k$ th-power-free and hence $b / y^{k}=a_{i}$ for some $i \\leq n$. So $b / a_{i}$ is the $k$ th power of an integer, which contradicts the definition of $b$.\n\n\n\nThus $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots$ are exactly all $k$ th-power-free positive integers; consequently all primes are contained in this sequence."

            "Step 1. Enumerate all the tokens in the initial arrangement in clockwise circular order; also enumerate the vertices of the $2 n$-gon accordingly. Consider any three tokens $i<j<k$. At each moment, their cyclic order may be either $i, j, k$ or $i, k, j$, counted clockwise. This order changes exactly when two of these three tokens have been switched. Hence the order has been reversed thrice, and in the final arrangement token $k$ stands on the arc passing clockwise from token $i$ to token $j$. Thus, at the end, token $i+1$ is a counter-clockwise neighbor of token $i$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, 2 n-1$, so the tokens in the final arrangement are numbered successively in counter-clockwise circular order.\n\n\n\nThis means that the final arrangement of tokens can be obtained from the initial one by reflection in some line $\\ell$.\n\n\n\nStep 2. Notice that each token was involved into $2 n-1$ switchings, so its initial and final vertices have different parity. Hence $\\ell$ passes through the midpoints of two opposite sides of a $2 n$-gon; we may assume that these are the sides $a$ and $b$ connecting $2 n$ with 1 and $n$ with $n+1$, respectively.\n\n\n\nDuring the process, each token $x$ has crossed $\\ell$ at least once; thus one of its switchings has been made at edge $a$ or at edge $b$. Assume that some two its switchings were performed at $a$ and at $b$; we may (and will) assume that the one at $a$ was earlier, and $x \\leq n$. Then the total movement of token $x$ consisted at least of: (i) moving from vertex $x$ to $a$ and crossing $\\ell$ along $a$; (ii) moving from $a$ to $b$ and crossing $\\ell$ along $b$; (iii) coming to vertex $2 n+1-x$. This tales at least $x+n+(n-x)=2 n$ switchings, which is impossible.\n\n\n\nThus, each token had a switching at exactly one of the edges $a$ and $b$.\n\n\n\nStep 3. Finally, let us show that either each token has been switched at $a$, or each token has been switched at $b$ (then the other edge has never been used, as desired). To the contrary, assume that there were switchings at both $a$ and at $b$. Consider the first such switchings, and let $x$ and $y$ be the tokens which were moved clockwise during these switchings and crossed $\\ell$ at $a$ and $b$, respectively. By Step 2, $x \\neq y$. Then tokens $x$ and $y$ initially were on opposite sides of $\\ell$.\n\n\n\nNow consider the switching of tokens $x$ and $y$; there was exactly one such switching, and we assume that it has been made on the same side of $\\ell$ as vertex $y$. Then this switching has been made after token $x$ had traced $a$. From this point on, token $x$ is on the clockwise arc from token $y$ to $b$, and it has no way to leave out from this arc. But this is impossible, since token $y$ should trace $b$ after that moment. A contradiction."

For convenience, we may and will assume that $P(x), Q(x), R(x), S(x)$ are all monic; hence so is $F(x)$. The argument hinges on the lemma below.\n\n\n\nLemma. If $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $m n$, then there exists a degree $n$ monic polynomial $g(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(f(x)-g(x)^{m}\\right)<(m-1) n$. (If $m=0$ or 1 , or $n=0$, the conclusion is still consistent with the usual convention that the identically zero polynomial has degree $-\\infty$.)\n\n\n\nProof. Write $f(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{m n} \\alpha_{k} x^{k}, \\alpha_{m n}=1$, and seek $g(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\beta_{k} x^{k}, \\beta_{n}=1$, so as to fit the bill. To this end, notice that, for each positive integer $k \\leq n$, the coefficient of $x^{m n-k}$ in the expansion of $g(x)^{m}$ is of the form $m \\beta_{n-k}+\\varphi_{k}\\left(\\beta_{n}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n-k+1}\\right)$, where $\\varphi_{k}\\left(\\beta_{n}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n-k+1}\\right)$ is an algebraic expression in $\\beta_{n}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n-k+1}$. Recall that $\\beta_{n}=1$ to determine the $\\beta_{n-k}$ recursively by requiring $\\beta_{n-k}=$ $\\frac{1}{m}\\left(a_{m n-k}-\\varphi_{k}\\left(\\beta_{n}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n-k+1}\\right)\\right), k=1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nThe outcome is then the desired polynomial $g(x)$.\n\n\n\nWe are now in a position to prove that $c=$ 1. Suppose, if possible, that $c>1$. By the lemma, there exist monic polynomials $U(x)$ and $V(x)$ of degree $b$ and $a$, respectively, such that $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(P(x)-U(x)^{c}\\right)<(c-1) b$ and $\\operatorname{deg}(R(x)-$ $\\left.V(x)^{c}\\right)<(c-1) a$. Then $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(F(x)-U(Q(x))^{c}\\right)=$ $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(P(Q(x))-U(Q(x))^{c}\\right)<(c-1) a b d, \\operatorname{deg}(F(x)-$ $\\left.V(S(x))^{c}\\right)=\\operatorname{deg}\\left(R(S(x))-V(S(x))^{c}\\right)<(c-1) a b d$, so $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(U(Q(x))^{c}-V(S(x))^{c}\\right)=\\operatorname{deg}((F(x)-$ $\\left.\\left.V(S(x))^{c}\\right)-\\left(F(x)-U(Q(x))^{c}\\right)\\right)<(c-1) a b d$.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, $U(Q(x))^{c}-V(S(x))^{c}=$ $(U(Q(x))-V(S(x)))\\left(U(Q(x))^{c-1}+\\cdots+\\right.$ $\\left.V(S(x))^{c-1}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nBy the preceding, the degree of the left-hand member is (strictly) less than $(c-1) a b d$ which is precisely the degree of the second factor in the righthand member. This forces $U(Q(x))=V(S(x))$, so $U(Q(x))=V(S(x))$ has degree $a b d<a b c d=$ $\\operatorname{deg} F(x)$ - a contradiction. Consequently, $c=1$.

Thus, $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B})$-minimal triangles are all adequate.\n\n\n\nConsider now a partition of $\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{A} \\sqcup \\mathcal{B}$, where $|\\mathcal{A}|=1$. Choose an $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B})$-minimal triangle and add to $\\mathcal{A}$ its vertices from $\\mathcal{B}$ to obtain a new partition also written $\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{A} \\sqcup \\mathcal{B}$. Continuing, choose an $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B})$-minimal triangle and add to $\\mathcal{A}$ its vertices/vertex from $\\mathcal{B}$ and so on and so forth all the way down for at least another $\\frac{1}{2}(n-5)$ steps - this works at least as many times, since at each step, $\\mathcal{B}$ loses at most two points. Clearly, each step provides a new adequate triangle, so the overall number of adequate triangles is at least $\\frac{1}{2}(n-1)$, as required."

            "We will prove the following, more general statement:\n\n\n\nClaim. Write down a finite number (at least two) of pairwise distinct positive integers on a board. A move consists in erasing any two numbers $a$ and $b$, and, for each $c$ in $\\{a+b,|a-b|\\}$, writing $c$ down on the board, unless $c$ is already there; if $c$ is already on the board, do nothing. Then it is possible to be left with exactly two numbers on the board after a finite number of moves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that, if we divide all numbers on the board by some common factor, the resulting process goes on equally well. Such a reduction can therefore be performed after any move.\n\n\n\nNotice that we cannot be left with less than two numbers. So it suffices to show that, given $k$ positive integers on the board, $k \\geq 3$, we can always decrease their number by at least 1 . Arguing indirectly, choose a set of $k \\geq 3$ positive integers $S=\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$ which cannot be reduced in size by a sequence of moves, having a minimal possible sum $\\sigma$. So, in any sequence of moves applied to $S$, two numbers are erased and exactly two numbers appear on each move. Moreover, the sum of any resulting set of $k$ numbers is at least $\\sigma$.\n\n\n\nNotice that, given two numbers $a>b$ on the board, we can replace them by $a+b$ and $a-b$, and then, performing a move on the two new numbers, by $(a+b)+(a-b)=2 a$ and $(a+b)-(a-b)=2 b$. So we can double any two numbers on the board.\n\n\n\nWe now show that, if the board contains two even numbers $a$ and $b$, we can divide them both by 2 , while keeping the other numbers unchanged. If $k$ is even, split the other numbers into pairs to multiply each pair by 2 ; then clear out the common factor 2 . If $k$ is odd, split all numbers but $a$ into pairs to multiply each by 2 ; then do the same for all numbers but $b$; finally, clear out the common factor 4.\n\n\n\nBack to the problem, if two of the numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ are even, reduce them both by 2 to get a set with a smaller sum, which is impossible. Otherwise, two numbers, say, $a_{1}<a_{2}$, are odd, and we may replace them by the two even numbers $a_{1}+a_{2}$ and $a_{2}-a_{1}$, and then by $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\\right)$ and $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{2}-a_{1}\\right)$, to get a set with a smaller sum, which is again impossible."

Let $P$ be a convex polygon satisfying the problem conditions - i.e., it has integer sides, perimeter $6 n$, and $60^{\\circ}$ rotational symmetry. Then $P$ can be tiled with unit equilateral triangles and unit lozenges with angles at least $60^{\\circ}$, with tiles meeting completely along edges, so that the tile configuration has a total of exactly $3 n^{2}+3 n+1$ distinct vertices.\n\n\n\nProof. Induct on $n$. The base case, $n=1$, is clear.\n\n\n\nNow take a polygon $P$ of perimeter $6 n \\geq 12$. Place six equilateral triangles inwards on six edges corresponding to each other upon rotation at $60^{\\circ}$. It is possible to stick a lozenge to each other edge, as shown in the Figure below.\n\n\n\nWe show that all angles of the lozenges are at least $60^{\\circ}$.

Moreover, let $B A C$ be a part of the boundary of some tile $T$, and let $X$ be any point of the boundary of $T$, lying outside the half-open intervals $[A, B)$ and $[A, C)$ (in this case, we say that $X$ is not adjacent to $A$ ).

It can be done in many ways; below we present one of them.\n\n\n\nLet $g(x)=x+1$; the construction of $h$ is more involved. For every $x \\in[0,1)$ we define the set $S_{x}=x+\\mathbb{Z}$; the sets $S_{x}$ will be exactly the components of $G_{g, h}$.

Analogously, if $x_{i}=1$ then there exists a blue edge $(x+3 i-2) \\rightarrow(x+3 i)$; then the edge $(y+3 i-2) \\rightarrow(y+3 i)$ also should exist, so $y_{i}=1$.

            "We start with a lemma which holds even in a more general setup.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. Let $P Q R S$ be a convex quadrangle whose diagonals meet at $O$. Let $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ be the circles on diameters $P Q$ and $R S$, respectively, and let $\\ell$ be their radical axis. Finally, choose the points $A, B$, and $C$ outside this quadrangle so that: the point $P$ (respectively, $Q$ ) lies on the segment $A B$ (respectively, $B C$ ); and $A O \\perp P S, B O \\perp P Q$, and $C O \\perp Q R$. Then the three lines $A C, P Q$, and $\\ell$ are concurrent or parallel.\n\n\n\nProof. Assume first that the lines $P R$ and $Q S$ are not perpendicular. Let $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ be the orthocentres of the triangles $O S P$ and $O Q R$, respectively; notice that $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ do not coincide.\n\n\n\nSince $H_{1}$ is the radical centre of the circles on diameters $R S, S P$, and $P Q$, it lies on $\\ell$. Similarly, $H_{2}$ lies on $\\ell$, so the lines $H_{1} H_{2}$ and $\\ell$ coincide.\n\n\n\nThe corresponding sides of the triangles $A P H_{1}$ and $C Q H_{2}$ meet at $O, B$, and the orthocentre of the triangle $O P Q$ (which lies on $O B$ ). By Desargues' theorem, the lines $A C, P Q$ and $\\ell$ are concurrent or parallel.\n\n\n\n<img_3558>\n\n\n\nThe case when $P R \\perp Q S$ may be considered as a limit case, since the configuration in the statement of the lemma allows arbitrarily small perturbations. The lemma is proved.\n\n\n\nBack to the problem, let the segments $P R$ and $Q S$ cross at $O$, let $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ be the circles on diameters $P Q$ and $R S$, respectively, and let $\\ell$ be their radical axis. By the Lemma, the three lines $A C, \\ell$, and $P Q$ are concurrent or parallel, and similarly so are the three lines $A C, \\ell$, and $R S$. Thus, if the lines $A C$ and $\\ell$ are distinct, all four lines are concurrent or pairwise parallel.\n\n\n\nThis is clearly the case when the lines $P S$ and $Q R$ are not parallel (since $\\ell$ crosses $O A$ and $O C$ at the orthocentres of $O S P$ and $O Q R$, these orthocentres being distinct from $A$ and $C$ ). In this case, denote the concurrency point by $T$. If $T$ is not ideal, then we have $T P \\cdot T Q=T R \\cdot T S$ (as $T \\in \\ell$ ), so $P Q R S$ is cyclic. If $T$ is ideal (i.e., all four lines are parallel), then the segments $P Q$ and $R S$ have the same perpendicular bisector (namely, the line of centers of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ ), and $P Q R S$ is cyclic again.\n\n\n\nAssume now $P S$ and $Q R$ parallel. By symmetry, $P Q$ and $R S$ may also be assumed parallel: otherwise, the preceding argument goes through after relabelling. In this case, we need to prove that the parallelogram $P Q R S$ is a rectangle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img_3452>\n\n\n\nSuppose, by way of contradiction, that $O P>O Q$. Let the line through $O$ and parallel to $P Q$ meet $A B$ at $M$, and $C B$ at $N$. Since $O P>O Q$, the angle $S P Q$ is acute and the angle $P Q R$ is obtuse, so the angle $A O B$ is obtuse, the angle $B O C$ is acute, $M$ lies on the segment $A B$, and $N$ lies on the extension of the segment $B C$ beyond $C$. Therefore: $O A>O M$, since the angle $O M A$ is obtuse; $O M>O N$, since $O M: O N=K P: K Q$, where $K$ is the projection of $O$ onto $P Q$; and $O N>O C$, since the angle $O C N$ is obtuse. Consequently, $O A>O C$.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, $O R>O S$ yields $O C>O A$ : a contradiction. Consequently, $O P=O Q$ and $P Q R S$ is a rectangle. This ends the proof.",

From the identity\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d)=\\prod_{p \\mid a d-b c} \\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, c n+d),\n$$\n\nit is clear that every value taken by $\\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d)$ is also a value taken by the product (with all $\\left.n_{p}=n\\right)$. Conversely, it suffices to show that, given any positive integers $\\left(n_{p}\\right)_{p \\mid a d-b c}$, there is a positive integer $n$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, c n+d)=\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}\\left(a n_{p}+b, c n_{p}+d\\right)$ for each $p \\mid a d-b c$. This can be achieved by requiring that $n$ be congruent to $n_{p}$ modulo a sufficiently large ${ }^{1}$ power of $p$ (using the Chinese Remainder Theorem).\n\nUsing Claim 2, it suffices to determine the sets of values taken by $\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, c n+d)$ as $n$ ranges over all positive integers. There are two cases.\n\nClaim 3. If $p \\mid a, c$, then $\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, c n+d)=1$ for all $n$.\n\nProof. If $p \\mid a n+b, c n+d$, then we would have $p \\mid a, b, c, d$, which is not the case.\n\nClaim 4. If $p \\nmid a$ or $p \\nmid c$, then the values taken by $\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, c n+d)$ are exactly the $p$-power divisors of $a d-b c$.\n\nProof. Assume without loss of generality that $p \\nmid a$. Then from identity $(\\dagger)$ we have $\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+$ $b, c n+d)=\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, a d-b c)$. But since $p \\nmid a$, the arithmetic progression $a n+b$ takes all possible values modulo the highest $p$-power divisor of $a d-b c$, and in particular the values taken by $\\operatorname{gcd}_{p}(a n+b, a d-b c)$ are exactly the $p$-power divisors of $a d-b c$.\n\nConclusion. Using claims 2,3 and 4 , we see that the set of values taken by $\\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d)$ is equal to the set of products of $p$-power divisors of $a d-b c$, where we only consider those primes $p$ not dividing $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)$. Thus the set of values of $\\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d)$ is equal to the set of divisors of the largest factor of $a d-b c$ coprime to $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)$."

For any fixed positive $\\delta$, a graph on $v$ vertices whose girth is at least $\\delta v$ has at most $v+o(v)$ edges.\n\n\n\nProof. Define $f(v)$ to be the maximal number $f$ such that a graph on $v$ vertices whose girth is at least $\\delta v$ may have $v+f$ edges. We are interested in the recursive estimates for $f$.\n\n\n\nLet $G$ be a graph on $v$ vertices whose gifth is at least $\\delta v$ containing $v+f(v)$ edges. If $G$ contains a leaf (i.e., a vertex of degree 1), then one may remove this vertex along with its edge, obtaining a graph with at most $v-1+f(v-1)$ edges. Thus, in this case $f(v) \\leq f(v-1)$.\n\n\n\nDefine an isolated path of length $k$ to be a sequence of vertices $v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k}$, such that $v_{i}$ is connected to $v_{i+1}$, and each of the vertices $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$ has degree 2 (so, these vertices are connected only to their neighbors in the path). If $G$ contains an isolated path $v_{0}, \\ldots, v_{k}$ of length, say, $k>\\sqrt{v}$, then one may remove all its middle vertices $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$, along with all their $k$ edges. We obtain a graph on $v-k+1$ vertices with at most $(v-k+1)+f(v-k+1)$ edges. Thus, in this case $f(v) \\leq f(v-k+1)+1$.\n\n\n\nAssume now that the lengths of all isolated paths do not exceed $\\sqrt{v}$; we show that in this case $v$ is bounded from above. For that purpose, we replace each maximal isolated path by an edge between its endpoints, removing all middle vertices. We obtain a graph $H$ whose girth is at least $\\delta v / \\sqrt{v}=\\delta \\sqrt{v}$. Each vertex of $H$ has degree at least 3. By the girth condition, the neighborhood of any vertex $x$ of radius $r=\\lfloor(\\delta \\sqrt{v}-1) / 2\\rfloor$ is a tree rooted at $x$. Any vertex at level $i<r$ has at least two sons; so the tree contains at least $2^{\\lfloor(\\delta \\sqrt{v}-1) / 2\\rfloor}$ vertices (even at the last level). So, $v \\geq 2^{\\lfloor(\\delta \\sqrt{v}-1) / 2\\rfloor}$ which may happen only for a finite number of values of $v$.\n\n\n\nThus, for all large enough values of $v$, we have either $f(v) \\leq f(v-1)$ or $f(v) \\leq f(v-k+1)$ for some $k>\\sqrt{v}$. This easily yields $f(v)=o(v)$, as desired.\n\n\n\nNow we proceed to the problem. Consider a graph on $v$ vertices containing no two simple cycles of the same length. Take its $\\lfloor\\varepsilon v / 2\\rfloor$ shortest cycles (or all its cycles, if their total number is smaller) and remove an edge from each. We get a graph of girth at least $\\varepsilon v / 2$. By the lemma, the number of edges in the obtained graph is at most $v+o(v)$, so the number of edges in the initial graph is at most $v+\\varepsilon v / 2+o(v)$, which is smaller than $(1+\\varepsilon) v$ if $v$ is large enough."

This can be done either by referring to the Mason-Stothers theorem or directly, in terms of multiplicities of the roots in question.\n\nSince $P$ and $P+1$ are relatively prime, the Mason-Stothers theorem implies that the number of distinct roots of $P(P+1)$ is greater than $m$, hence at least $m+1$.\n\nFor a direct proof, let $z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{t}$ be the distinct complex roots of $P(P+1)$, and let $z_{k}$ have multiplicity $\\alpha_{k}, k=1, \\ldots, t$.

A move consists in orienting any unit grid-segment that has not been oriented before. If at some stage some oriented segments form an oriented cycle, Bob wins. Does Bob have a strategy that guarantees him to win?",
        "solution": [
            "The answer is in the negative: Ann has a strategy allowing her to prevent Bob's victory.\n\nWe say that two unit grid-segments form a low-left corner (or LL-corner) if they share an endpoint which is the lowest point of one and the leftmost point of the other. An up-right corner (or UR-corner) is defined similarly. The common endpoint of two unit grid-segments at a corner is the joint of that corner.\n\nFix a vertical line on the grid and call it the midline; the unit grid-segments along the midline are called middle segments. The unit grid-segments lying to the left/right of the midline are called left/right segments. Partition all left segments into LL-corners, and all right segments into UR-corners.\n\nWe now describe Ann's strategy. Her first move consists in orienting some middle segment arbitrarily. Assume that at some stage, Bob orients some segment $s$. If $s$ is a middle segment, Ann orients any free middle segment arbitrarily. Otherwise, $s$ forms a corner in the partition with some other segment $t$. Then Ann orients $t$ so that the joint of the corner is either the source of both arrows, or the target of both. Notice that after any move of Ann's, each corner in the partition is either completely oriented or completely not oriented. This means that Ann can always make a required move.\n\nAssume that Bob wins at some stage, i.e., an oriented cycle $C$ occurs. Let $X$ be the lowest of the leftmost points of $C$, and let $Y$ be the topmost of the rightmost points of $C$. If $X$ lies (strictly) to the left of the midline, then $X$ is the joint of some corner whose segments are both oriented. But, according to Ann's strategy, they are oriented so that they cannot occur in a cycle - a contradiction. Otherwise, $Y$ lies to the right of the midline, and a similar argument applies. Thus, Bob will never win, as desired.\n\n\n### 分析"

A horizontal or vertical line, which intersects the interior of the square but does not intersect the interior of any rectangle, will be called a splitting line. A rectangle having no point on the boundary of the square will be called an interior rectangle.\n\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there exists a dissection of the square into more than one rectangle, such that no interior rectangle and no splitting line appear. Consider such a dissection with the least possible number of rectangles. Notice that this number of rectangles is greater than 2, otherwise their common side provides a splitting line.\n\nIf there exist two rectangles having a common side, then we can replace them by their union (see Figure 1). The number of rectangles was greater than 2, so in a new dissection it is greater than 1. Clearly, in the new dissection, there is also no splitting line as well as no interior rectangle. This contradicts the choice of the original dissection.\n\nDenote the initial square by $A B C D$, with $A$ and $B$ being respectively the lower left and lower right vertices. Consider those two rectangles $a$ and $b$ containing vertices $A$ and $B$, respectively. (Note that $a \\neq b$, otherwise its top side provides a splitting line.) We can assume that the height of $a$ is not greater than that of $b$. Then consider the rectangle $c$ neighboring to the lower right corner of $a$ (it may happen that $c=b$ ).

Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$, and its left side provides a splitting line. Contradiction.\n\nCase 2. The height of $c$ is greater than that of $a$. Analogously, consider the rectangle $d$ containing the angle marked on Figure 3. It has no common point with $A D$ (otherwise it has a common side with $a$ ), as well as no common point with $A B$ or with $B C$ (obviously). Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$.

Observe that a rectangle cannot be attached to two opposite sides, otherwise one of its sides lies on a splitting line.\n\nWe say that two rectangles are opposite if they are attached to opposite sides of $A B C D$. We claim that there exist two opposite rectangles having a common point.\n\nConsider the union $L$ of all rectangles attached to the left. Assume, to the contrary, that $L$ has no common point with the rectangles attached to the right. Take a polygonal line $p$ connecting the top and the bottom sides of the square and passing close from the right to the boundary of $L$ (see Figure 4). Then all its points belong to the rectangles attached either to the top or to the bottom. Moreover, the upper end-point of $p$ belongs to a rectangle attached to the top, and the lower one belongs to an other rectangle attached to the bottom. Hence, there is a point on $p$ where some rectangles attached to the top and to the bottom meet each other. So, there always exists a pair of neighboring opposite rectangles.\n\n<img_3470>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3863>\n\nFigure 5\n\n<img_3721>\n\nFigure 6\n\nNow, take two opposite neighboring rectangles $a$ and $b$. We can assume that $a$ is attached to the left and $b$ is attached to the right. Let $X$ be their common point. If $X$ belongs to their horizontal sides (in particular, $X$ may appear to be a common vertex of $a$ and $b$ ), then these sides provide a splitting line (see Figure 5). Otherwise, $X$ lies on the vertical sides. Let $\\ell$ be the line containing these sides.\n\nSince $\\ell$ is not a splitting line, it intersects the interior of some rectangle. Let $c$ be such a rectangle, closest to $X$; we can assume that $c$ lies above $X$. Let $Y$ be the common point of $\\ell$ and the bottom side of $c$ (see Figure 6). Then $Y$ is also a vertex of two rectangles lying below $c$.\n\nSo, let $Y$ be the upper-right and upper-left corners of the rectangles $a^{\\prime}$ and $b^{\\prime}$, respectively. Then $a^{\\prime}$ and $b^{\\prime}$ are situated not lower than $a$ and $b$, respectively (it may happen that $a=a^{\\prime}$ or $b=b^{\\prime}$ ). We claim that $a^{\\prime}$ is attached to the left. If $a=a^{\\prime}$ then of course it is. If $a \\neq a^{\\prime}$ then $a^{\\prime}$ is above $a$, below $c$ and to the left from $b^{\\prime}$. Hence, it can be attached to the left only.\n\nAnalogously, $b^{\\prime}$ is attached to the right. Now, the top sides of these two rectangles pass through $Y$, hence they provide a splitting line again. This last contradiction completes the proof."

To obtain the term $b_{i}$, we increased and decreased number $a_{i}$ by one several times. Therefore $b_{i}-a_{i}$ is always an integer, and there are not more than $n$ possible values for $b_{i}$. So, there are not more than $n^{n}$ distinct possible sequences $A_{k}$, and hence two of the sequences $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n^{n}+1}$ should be identical, say $A_{p}=A_{q}$ for some $p<q$.\n\nFor any positive integer $k$, let $S_{k}$ be the sum of squares of elements in $A_{k}$.

So it can be assumed that $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+a}$ have opposite colors for each $n$.\n\nSimilarly, it also can be assumed that $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+b}$ have opposite colors. Then, by induction on $|p|+|q|$, we obtain that for arbitrary integers $p$ and $q$, strips $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+p a+q b}$ have the same color if $p+q$ is even, and these two strips have opposite colors if $p+q$ is odd.\n\nLet $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b), a_{1}=a / d$ and $b_{1}=b / d$. Apply the result above for $p=b_{1}$ and $q=-a_{1}$. The strips $S_{0}$ and $S_{0+b_{1} a-a_{1} b}$ are identical and therefore they have the same color. Hence, $a_{1}+b_{1}$ is even. By the construction, $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are coprime, so this is possible only if both are odd.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume $a>b$.

            "We present an algorithm to arrange the competitors. Let the two rooms be Room A and Room B.

At any state of the algorithm, $A$ and $B$ denote the sets of the competitors in the rooms, and $c(A)$ and $c(B)$ denote the largest sizes of cliques in the rooms, respectively.\n\nStep 1. Let $M$ be one of the cliques of largest size, $|M|=2 m$. Send all members of $M$ to Room $A$ and all other competitors to Room $B$.\n\nSince $M$ is a clique of the largest size, we have $c(A)=|M| \\geq c(B)$.\n\nStep 2.

So at the end we have $c(A) \\leq c(B) \\leq c(A)+1$.\n\nWe also have $c(A)=|A| \\geq m$ at the end. Otherwise we would have at least $m+1$ members of $M$ in Room $B$ and at most $m-1$ in Room $A$, implying $c(B)-c(A) \\geq(m+1)-(m-1)=2$.\n\nStep 3. Let $k=c(A)$. If $c(B)=k$ then $S T O P$.\n\nIf we reached $c(A)=c(B)=k$ then we have found the desired arrangement.\n\nIn all other cases we have $c(B)=k+1$.\n\nFrom the estimate above we also know that $k=|A|=|A \\cap M| \\geq m$ and $|B \\cap M| \\leq m$.\n\nStep 4.

Due to $x \\notin C, c(B)=|C|$ is not decreased, and after this step we have $c(A)=c(B)=k+1$.\n\n\n\nIf there is no such competitor $x$, then in Room $B$, all cliques of size $k+1$ contain $B \\cap M$ as a subset.\n\nStep 5. While $c(B)=k+1$, choose a clique $C \\subset B$ such that $|C|=k+1$ and move one member of $C \\backslash M$ to Room $A$.\n\n<img_3439>\n\nNote that $|C|=k+1>m \\geq|B \\cap M|$, so $C \\backslash M$ cannot be empty.\n\nEvery time we move a single person from Room $B$ to Room $A$, so $c(B)$ decreases by at most 1 . Hence, at the end of this loop we have $c(B)=k$.\n\nIn Room $A$ we have the clique $A \\cap M$ with size $|A \\cap M|=k$ thus $c(A) \\geq k$. We prove that there is no clique of larger size there. Let $Q \\subset A$ be an arbitrary clique. We show that $|Q| \\leq k$.\n\n<img_3320>\n\nIn Room $A$, and specially in set $Q$, there can be two types of competitors:\n\n- Some members of $M$. Since $M$ is a clique, they are friends with all members of $B \\cap M$.\n- Competitors which were moved to Room $A$ in Step 5 . Each of them has been in a clique with $B \\cap M$ so they are also friends with all members of $B \\cap M$.\n\nHence, all members of $Q$ are friends with all members of $B \\cap M$. Sets $Q$ and $B \\cap M$ are cliques themselves, so $Q \\cup(B \\cap M)$ is also a clique.

On the circumcircle, let $P$ be the point opposite to $A$, and let the angle bisector $A I$ intersect the circle again at $M$. Since $A K=A P=2 R$, triangle $A K P$ is isosceles. It is known that $\\angle B A D=\\angle C A O$, hence $\\angle D A I=\\angle B A I-\\angle B A D=\\angle C A I-$ $\\angle C A O=\\angle O A I$, and $A M$ is the bisector line in triangle $A K P$.

Otherwise, if $y<x$, property (ii) yields that pair $(y, x)$ is also bad while $2 y+x<2 x+y$. Both cases contradict the assumption that $2 x+y$ is minimal; the Lemma is proved.\n\nTo prove the problem statement, apply the Lemma for $x=k$ and $y=2 n$; the number $8 k n-1$ divides $\\left(4 k^{2}-1\\right)^{2}$ if and only if $k=2 n$. Hence, there is no such $n$ if $k$ is odd and $n=k / 2$ is the only solution if $k$ is even."

The numbers $a<b+x<c+x$ are the sides of a triangle because $(c+x)-(b+x)=$ $c-b<a$.

Note that for this reason (1) entails\n\n$$\nf(x+y) \\leq y f(x)\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$.\n\nStep 2. We proceed by proving that $f$ has at least one zero. If $f(0)=0$, we are done. Otherwise, in view of Step 1 we get $f(0)<0$. Observe that (5) tells us now $f(y) \\leq y f(0)$ for all real numbers $y$. Thus we can specify a positive real number $a$ that is so large that $f(a)^{2}>-f(0)$. Put $b=f(a)$ and substitute $x=b$ and $y=-b$ into (5); we learn $-b^{2}<f(0) \\leq-b f(b)$, i.e. $b<f(b)$.

Next we show that if $f(a)=0$ and $b<a$, then $f(b)=0$ as well. To see this, we just substitute $x=b$ and $y=a-b$ into (5), thus getting $f(b) \\geq 0$, which suffices by Step 1 .\n\nStep 4. By Step 3, the solution of the problem is reduced to showing $f(0)=0$. Pick any zero $r$ of $f$ and substitute $x=r$ and $y=-1$ into (1). Because of $f(r)=f(r-1)=0$ this gives $f(0) \\geq 0$ and hence $f(0)=0$ by Step 1 again."

This means that the function $S(j)-$ $S(j+100)$ changes sign somewhere on the segment $[i-100, i]$, so there exists some index $j \\in$ $[i-100, i-1]$ such that\n\n$$\nS_{100}(j) \\leq S_{100}(j+100)-1, \\quad \\text { but } \\quad S_{100}(j+1) \\geq S_{100}(j+101)+1\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nSubtracting the first inequality from the second one, we get $a_{j+100}-a_{j} \\geq a_{j+200}-a_{j+100}+2$, so\n\n$$\na_{j}=0, \\quad a_{j+100}=1, \\quad a_{j+200}=0\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the inequalities of (1), we also obtain $S_{99}(j+1) \\leq S_{99}(j+101) \\leq S_{99}(j+1)$, which implies\n\n$$\nS_{99}(j+1)=S_{99}(j+101) .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNow let $k$ and $\\ell$ be the least positive integers such that $a_{j-k}=1$ and $a_{j+200+\\ell}=1$. By symmetry, we may assume that $k \\geq \\ell$. If $k \\geq 200$ then we have $a_{j}=a_{j-1}=\\cdots=a_{j-199}=0$, so $S_{100}(j-199)=S_{100}(j-99)=0$, which contradicts the initial assumption. Hence $\\ell \\leq k \\leq 199$. Finally, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nS_{100+\\ell}(j-\\ell+1)=\\left(a_{j-\\ell+1}+\\cdots+a_{j}\\right)+S_{99}(j+1)+a_{j+100}=S_{99}(j+1)+1 \\\\\nS_{100+\\ell}(j+101)=S_{99}(j+101)+\\left(a_{j+200}+\\cdots+a_{j+200+\\ell-1}\\right)+a_{j+200+\\ell}=S_{99}(j+101)+1\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nComparing with (2) we get $S_{100+\\ell}(j-\\ell+1)=S_{100+\\ell}(j+101)$ and $100+\\ell \\leq 299$, which again contradicts our assumption."

        "question": "Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points of $\\mathcal{S}$ are collinear. By a windmill we mean a process as follows. Start with a line $\\ell$ going through a point $P \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Rotate $\\ell$ clockwise around the pivot $P$ until the line contains another point $Q$ of $\\mathcal{S}$. The point $Q$ now takes over as the new pivot. This process continues indefinitely, with the pivot always being a point from $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nShow that for a suitable $P \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and a suitable starting line $\\ell$ containing $P$, the resulting windmill will visit each point of $\\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot infinitely often.",
        "solution": [
            "Give the rotating line an orientation and distinguish its sides as the oranje side and the blue side. Notice that whenever the pivot changes from some point $T$ to another point $U$, after the change, $T$ is on the same side as $U$ was before. Therefore, the number of elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ on the oranje side and the number of those on the blue side remain the same throughout the whole process (except for those moments when the line contains two points).\n<img_3677>\n\nFirst consider the case that $|\\mathcal{S}|=2 n+1$ is odd. We claim that through any point $T \\in \\mathcal{S}$, there is a line that has $n$ points on each side. To see this, choose an oriented line through $T$ containing no other point of $\\mathcal{S}$ and suppose that it has $n+r$ points on its oranje side. If $r=0$ then we have established the claim, so we may assume that $r \\neq 0$. As the line rotates through $180^{\\circ}$ around $T$, the number of points of $\\mathcal{S}$ on its oranje side changes by 1 whenever the line passes through a point; after $180^{\\circ}$, the number of points on the oranje side is $n-r$. Therefore there is an intermediate stage at which the oranje side, and thus also the blue side, contains $n$ points.\n\nNow select the point $P$ arbitrarily, and choose a line through $P$ that has $n$ points of $\\mathcal{S}$ on each side to be the initial state of the windmill. We will show that during a rotation over $180^{\\circ}$, the line of the windmill visits each point of $\\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot. To see this, select any point $T$ of $\\mathcal{S}$ and select a line $\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$ through $T$ that separates $\\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves. The point $T$ is the unique point of $\\mathcal{S}$ through which a line in this direction can separate the points of $\\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves (parallel translation would disturb the balance). Therefore, when the windmill line is parallel to $\\ell$, it must be $\\ell$ itself, and so pass through $T$.\n\nNext suppose that $|\\mathcal{S}|=2 n$. Similarly to the odd case, for every $T \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there is an oriented\n\n\n\nline through $T$ with $n-1$ points on its oranje side and $n$ points on its blue side. Select such an oriented line through an arbitrary $P$ to be the initial state of the windmill.\n\nWe will now show that during a rotation over $360^{\\circ}$, the line of the windmill visits each point of $\\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot. To see this, select any point $T$ of $\\mathcal{S}$ and an oriented line $\\ell$ through $T$ that separates $\\mathcal{S}$ into two subsets with $n-1$ points on its oranje and $n$ points on its blue side. Again, parallel translation would change the numbers of points on the two sides, so when the windmill line is parallel to $\\ell$ with the same orientation, the windmill line must pass through $T$."

For any word $R$ of length $m$, we call the number of indices $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, N\\}$ for which $R$ coincides with the subword $x_{i+1} x_{i+2} \\ldots x_{i+m}$ of $W$ the multiplicity of $R$ and denote it by $\\mu(R)$. Thus a word $R$ appears in $W$ if and only if $\\mu(R)>0$. Since each occurrence of a word in $W$ is both succeeded by either the letter $a$ or the letter $b$ and similarly preceded by one of those two letters, we have\n\n$$\n\\mu(R)=\\mu(R a)+\\mu(R b)=\\mu(a R)+\\mu(b R)\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor all words $R$.\n\nWe claim that the condition that $N$ is in fact the minimal period of $W$ guarantees that each word of length $N$ has multiplicity 1 or 0 depending on whether it appears or not. Indeed, if the words $x_{i+1} x_{i+2} \\ldots x_{i+N}$ and $x_{j+1} \\ldots x_{j+N}$ are equal for some $1 \\leq i<j \\leq N$, then we have $x_{i+a}=x_{j+a}$ for every integer $a$, and hence $j-i$ is also a period.\n\nMoreover, since $N>2^{n}$, at least one of the two words $a$ and $b$ has a multiplicity that is strictly larger than $2^{n-1}$.\n\nFor each $k=0,1, \\ldots, n-1$, let $U_{k}$ be a subword of $W$ whose multiplicity is strictly larger than $2^{k}$ and whose length is maximal subject to this property. Note that such a word exists in view of the two observations made in the two previous paragraphs.\n\nFix some index $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. Since the word $U_{k} b$ is longer than $U_{k}$, its multiplicity can be at most $2^{k}$, so in particular $\\mu\\left(U_{k} b\\right)<\\mu\\left(U_{k}\\right)$. Therefore, the word $U_{k} a$ has to appear by (1). For a similar reason, the words $U_{k} b, a U_{k}$, and $b U_{k}$ have to appear as well. Hence, the word $U_{k}$ is ubiquitous. Moreover, if the multiplicity of $U_{k}$ were strictly greater than $2^{k+1}$, then by (11) at least one of the two words $U_{k} a$ and $U_{k} b$ would have multiplicity greater than $2^{k}$ and would thus violate the maximality condition imposed on $U_{k}$.\n\nSo we have $\\mu\\left(U_{0}\\right) \\leq 2<\\mu\\left(U_{1}\\right) \\leq 4<\\ldots \\leq 2^{n-1}<\\mu\\left(U_{n-1}\\right)$, which implies in particular that the words $U_{0}, U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{n-1}$ have to be distinct.

The first part follows by plugging $m=0$ into Claim 1. Using Claim 1 twice with $m=-1$, we get $f(n)|f(-n)| f(n)$, from which the second part follows.\n\nFrom Claim 1, we get $f(1) \\mid f(n)$ for all integers $n$, so $f(1)$ is the minimal value attained by $f$. Next, from Claim 2, the function $f$ can attain only a finite number of values since all these values divide $f(0)$.\n\nNow we prove the statement of the problem by induction on the number $N_{f}$ of values attained by $f$. In the base case $N_{f} \\leq 2$, we either have $f(0) \\neq f(1)$, in which case these two numbers are the only values attained by $f$ and the statement is clear, or we have $f(0)=f(1)$, in which case we have $f(1)|f(n)| f(0)$ for all integers $n$, so $f$ is constant and the statement is obvious again.\n\nFor the induction step, assume that $N_{f} \\geq 3$, and let $a$ be the least positive integer with $f(a)>f(1)$. Note that such a number exists due to the symmetry of $f$ obtained in Claim 2 .\n\n\n\nClaim 3. $f(n) \\neq f(1)$ if and only if $a \\mid n$.\n\nProof. Since $f(1)=\\cdots=f(a-1)<f(a)$, the claim follows from the fact that\n\n$$\nf(n)=f(1) \\Longleftrightarrow f(n+a)=f(1) .\n$$\n\nSo it suffices to prove this fact.\n\nAssume that $f(n)=f(1)$. Then $f(n+a) \\mid f(a)-f(-n)=f(a)-f(n)>0$, so $f(n+a) \\leq$ $f(a)-f(n)<f(a)$; in particular the difference $f(n+a)-f(n)$ is stricly smaller than $f(a)$. Furthermore, this difference is divisible by $f(a)$ and nonnegative since $f(n)=f(1)$ is the least value attained by $f$. So we have $f(n+a)-f(n)=0$, as desired. For the converse direction we only need to remark that $f(n+a)=f(1)$ entails $f(-n-a)=f(1)$, and hence $f(n)=f(-n)=f(1)$ by the forward implication.\n\nWe return to the induction step. So let us take two arbitrary integers $m$ and $n$ with $f(m) \\leq f(n)$. If $a \\nmid m$, then we have $f(m)=f(1) \\mid f(n)$. On the other hand, suppose that $a \\mid m$; then by Claim $3 a \\mid n$ as well. Now define the function $g(x)=f(a x)$. Clearly, $g$ satisfies the conditions of the problem, but $N_{g}<N_{f}-1$, since $g$ does not attain $f(1)$. Hence, by the induction hypothesis, $f(m)=g(m / a) \\mid g(n / a)=f(n)$, as desired."

On the other hand, for each $p_{i}$ there exist exactly $\\frac{p_{i}+1}{2}$ quadratic residues modulo $p_{i}$; by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of quadratic residues modulo $n$ is exactly $\\frac{p_{1}+1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{p_{2}+1}{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{p_{s}+1}{2}$, including 0 . Then we have a contradiction by\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{1}+1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{p_{2}+1}{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{p_{s}+1}{2} \\leq \\frac{2 p_{1}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2 p_{2}}{3} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{2 p_{s}}{3}=\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{s} n \\leq \\frac{4 n}{9}<\\frac{n-1}{2}\n$$\n\nThis proves the \"if\"-part of the problem.\n\nStep II. Now suppose that $n$ is prime. For any $a \\in N$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(a)$ the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of $a$, and let $\\mu(a)=\\max \\left\\{t \\in[0, k] \\mid 2^{t} \\rightarrow a\\right\\}$.\n\nLemma. For any $a, b \\in N$, we have $a \\rightarrow b$ if and only if $\\nu_{2}(a) \\leq \\mu(b)$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell=\\nu_{2}(a)$ and $m=\\mu(b)$.\n\nSuppose $\\ell \\leq m$. Since $b$ follows $2^{m}$, there exists some $g_{0}$ such that $b \\equiv g_{0}^{2^{m}}(\\bmod n)$. By $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, n-1)=2^{\\ell}$ there exist some integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p a-q(n-1)=2^{\\ell}$. Choosing $g=g_{0}^{2^{m-\\ell} p}$ we have $g^{a}=g_{0}^{2^{m-\\ell} p a}=g_{0}^{2^{m}+2^{m-\\ell} q(n-1)} \\equiv g_{0}^{2^{m}} \\equiv b(\\bmod n)$ by FERMAT's theorem. Hence, $a \\rightarrow b$.\n\nTo prove the reverse statement, suppose that $a \\rightarrow b$, so $b \\equiv g^{a}(\\bmod n)$ with some $g$. Then $b \\equiv\\left(g^{a / 2^{\\ell}}\\right)^{2^{\\ell}}$, and therefore $2^{\\ell} \\rightarrow b$. By the definition of $\\mu(b)$, we have $\\mu(b) \\geq \\ell$. The lemma is\n\n\n\nproved.\n\nNow for every $i$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, let\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{i} & =\\left\\{a \\in N \\mid \\nu_{2}(a)=i\\right\\}, \\\\\nB_{i} & =\\{a \\in N \\mid \\mu(a)=i\\}, \\\\\n\\text { and } C_{i} & =\\{a \\in N \\mid \\mu(a) \\geq i\\}=B_{i} \\cup B_{i+1} \\cup \\ldots \\cup B_{k} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe claim that $\\left|A_{i}\\right|=\\left|B_{i}\\right|$ for all $0 \\leq i \\leq k$. Obviously we have $\\left|A_{i}\\right|=2^{k-i-1}$ for all $i=$ $0, \\ldots, k-1$, and $\\left|A_{k}\\right|=1$. Now we determine $\\left|C_{i}\\right|$. We have $\\left|C_{0}\\right|=n-1$ and by Fermat's theorem we also have $C_{k}=\\{1\\}$, so $\\left|C_{k}\\right|=1$. Next, notice that $C_{i+1}=\\left\\{x^{2} \\bmod n \\mid x \\in C_{i}\\right\\}$. For every $a \\in N$, the relation $x^{2} \\equiv a(\\bmod n)$ has at most two solutions in $N$. Therefore we have $2\\left|C_{i+1}\\right| \\leq\\left|C_{i}\\right|$, with the equality achieved only if for every $y \\in C_{i+1}$, there exist distinct elements $x, x^{\\prime} \\in C_{i}$ such that $x^{2} \\equiv x^{\\prime 2} \\equiv y(\\bmod n)$ (this implies $\\left.x+x^{\\prime}=n\\right)$. Now, since $2^{k}\\left|C_{k}\\right|=\\left|C_{0}\\right|$, we obtain that this equality should be achieved in each step. Hence $\\left|C_{i}\\right|=2^{k-i}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, and therefore $\\left|B_{i}\\right|=2^{k-i-1}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k-1$ and $\\left|B_{k}\\right|=1$.\n\nFrom the previous arguments we can see that for each $z \\in C_{i}(0 \\leq i<k)$ the equation $x^{2} \\equiv z^{2}$ $(\\bmod n)$ has two solutions in $C_{i}$, so we have $n-z \\in C_{i}$. Hence, for each $i=0,1, \\ldots, k-1$, exactly half of the elements of $C_{i}$ are odd. The same statement is valid for $B_{i}=C_{i} \\backslash C_{i+1}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k-2$. In particular, each such $B_{i}$ contains an odd number. Note that $B_{k}=\\{1\\}$ also contains an odd number, and $B_{k-1}=\\left\\{2^{k}\\right\\}$ since $C_{k-1}$ consists of the two square roots of 1 modulo $n$.\n\nStep III. Now we construct a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. First, for each $i$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, connect the elements of $A_{i}$ to the elements of $B_{i}$ by means of an arbitrary bijection. After performing this for every $i$, we obtain a subgraph with all vertices having in-degree 1 and outdegree 1, so the subgraph is a disjoint union of cycles. If there is a unique cycle, we are done. Otherwise, we modify the subgraph in such a way that the previous property is preserved and the number of cycles decreases; after a finite number of steps we arrive at a single cycle.\n\nFor every cycle $C$, let $\\lambda(C)=\\min _{c \\in C} \\nu_{2}(c)$. Consider a cycle $C$ for which $\\lambda(C)$ is maximal. If $\\lambda(C)=0$, then for any other cycle $C^{\\prime}$ we have $\\lambda\\left(C^{\\prime}\\right)=0$. Take two arbitrary vertices $a \\in C$ and $a^{\\prime} \\in C^{\\prime}$ such that $\\nu_{2}(a)=\\nu_{2}\\left(a^{\\prime}\\right)=0$; let their direct successors be $b$ and $b^{\\prime}$, respectively. Then we can unify $C$ and $C^{\\prime}$ to a single cycle by replacing the edges $a \\rightarrow b$ and $a^{\\prime} \\rightarrow b^{\\prime}$ by $a \\rightarrow b^{\\prime}$ and $a^{\\prime} \\rightarrow b$.\n\nNow suppose that $\\lambda=\\lambda(C) \\geq 1$; let $a \\in C \\cap A_{\\lambda}$. If there exists some $a^{\\prime} \\in A_{\\lambda} \\backslash C$, then $a^{\\prime}$ lies in another cycle $C^{\\prime}$ and we can merge the two cycles in exactly the same way as above. So, the only remaining case is $A_{\\lambda} \\subset C$. Since the edges from $A_{\\lambda}$ lead to $B_{\\lambda}$, we get also $B_{\\lambda} \\subset C$. If $\\lambda \\neq k-1$ then $B_{\\lambda}$ contains an odd number; this contradicts the assumption $\\lambda(C)>0$. Finally, if $\\lambda=k-1$, then $C$ contains $2^{k-1}$ which is the only element of $A_{k-1}$. Since $B_{k-1}=\\left\\{2^{k}\\right\\}=A_{k}$ and $B_{k}=\\{1\\}$, the cycle $C$ contains the path $2^{k-1} \\rightarrow 2^{k} \\rightarrow 1$ and it contains an odd number again. This completes the proof of the \"only if\"-part of the problem."

The equality $g(a)=a+1$ is similar.\n\nNow, we are prepared for the proof of the problem statement. First, we prove it for $n \\geq a$. Claim 4'. For each integer $x \\geq a$, we have $f(x)=g(x)=x+1$.\n\nProof. Induction on $x$. The base case $x=a$ is provided by Claim $3^{\\prime}$, while the induction step follows from $f(x+1)=f(g(x))=f(x)+1=(x+1)+1$ and the similar computation for $g(x+1)$.\n\nFinally, for an arbitrary $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we have $g(n) \\geq a$, so by Claim $4^{\\prime}$ we have $f(n)+1=$ $f(g(n))=g(n)+1$, hence $f(n)=g(n)$."

If, for instance, $j_{1}=j_{2}$, then the term contains $\\varepsilon_{i j_{1}}^{2}=1$, so we can replace this term by $\\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$. Make such replacements for each such term; obviously, after this change each term of the form $\\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$ will appear $P(T)$ times, hence\n\n$$\nS(T)=\\sum_{\\left|\\left\\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}\\right|=4} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}+P(T) \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\varepsilon_{i j}=S_{1}(T)+P(T) S_{2}(T)\n$$\n\n\n\nWe show that $S_{2}(T)=0$ and hence $S(T)=S_{1}(T)$ for each tournament. Actually, note that $\\varepsilon_{i j}=-\\varepsilon_{j i}$, and the whole sum can be split into such pairs. Since the sum in each pair is 0 , so is $S_{2}(T)$.\n\nThus the desired equality (2) rewrites as\n\n$$\nS_{1}(T)=\\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S_{1}\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right)\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nNow, if all the numbers $j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}$ are distinct, then the set $\\left\\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}$ is contained in exactly one 4-tuple, hence the term $\\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$ appears in the right-hand part of (3) exactly once, as well as in the left-hand part. Clearly, there are no other terms in both parts, so the equality is established.",
            "Similarly to the first solution, we call the subsets of players as companies, and the $k$-element subsets will be called as $k$-companies.\n\nIn any company of the players, call a player the local champion of the company if he defeated all other members of the company. Similarly, if a player lost all his games against the others in the company then call him the local loser of the company. Obviously every company has at most one local champion and at most one local loser. By the condition of the problem, whenever a 4-company has a local loser, then this company has a local champion as well.\n\nSuppose that $k$ is some positive integer, and let us count all cases when a player is the local champion of some $k$-company. The $i$ th player won against $w_{i}$ other player. To be the local champion of a $k$-company, he must be a member of the company, and the other $k-1$ members must be chosen from those whom he defeated. Therefore, the $i$ th player is the local champion of $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}w_{i} \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right) k$-companies. Hence, the total number of local champions of all $k$-companies is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}w_{i} \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of local losers of the $k$-companies is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\ell_{i} \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nNow apply this for $k=2,3$ and 4 .\n\nSince every game has a winner and a loser, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell_{i}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$, and hence\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)=0\n\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nIn every 3-company, either the players defeated one another in a cycle or the company has both a local champion and a local loser.

In each step:\n\n(i) The strings are ordered by their lengths in a non-increasing order. If there are some strings of equal lengths, then the white ones precede the black ones.

            "Denote the situation after the $i$ th step by $A_{i}$; hence $A_{0}$ is the initial situation, and $A_{i-1} \\rightarrow A_{i}$ is the $i$ th step. We call a string containing $m$ pearls an $m$-string; it is an $m$-w-string or a $m$-b-string if it is white or black, respectively.\n\nWe continue the process until every string consists of a single pearl. We will focus on three moments of the process: (a) the first stage $A_{s}$ when the first 1-string (no matter black or white) appears; (b) the first stage $A_{t}$ where the total number of strings is greater than $k$ (if such moment does not appear then we put $t=\\infty$ ); and (c) the first stage $A_{f}$ when all black pearls are isolated. It is sufficient to prove that in $A_{f-1}$ (or earlier), a 1-w-string appears.\n\nWe start with some easy properties of the situations under consideration. Obviously, we have $s \\leq f$. Moreover, all b-strings from $A_{f-1}$ become single pearls in the $f$ th step, hence all of them are 1 - or 2 -b-strings.\n\nNext, observe that in each step $A_{i} \\rightarrow A_{i+1}$ with $i \\leq t-1$, all $(>1)$-strings were cut since there are not more than $k$ strings at all; if, in addition, $i<s$, then there were no 1 -string, so all the strings were cut in this step.\n\nNow, let $B_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ be the lengths of the longest and the shortest b-strings in $A_{i}$, and let $W_{i}$ and $w_{i}$ be the same for w-strings. We show by induction on $i \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}$ that (i) the situation $A_{i}$ contains exactly $2^{i}$ black and $2^{i}$ white strings, (ii) $B_{i} \\geq W_{i}$, and (iii) $b_{i} \\geq w_{i}$. The base case $i=0$ is obvious. For the induction step, if $i \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}$ then in the $i$ th step, each string is cut, thus the claim (i) follows from the induction hypothesis; next, we have $B_{i}=\\left\\lceil B_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rceil \\geq\\left\\lceil W_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rceil=W_{i}$ and $b_{i}=\\left\\lfloor b_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rfloor \\geq\\left\\lfloor w_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rfloor=w_{i}$, thus establishing (ii) and (iii).\n\nFor the numbers $s, t, f$, two cases are possible.\n\nCase 1. Suppose that $s \\leq t$ or $f \\leq t+1$ (and hence $s \\leq t+1$ ); in particular, this is true when $t=\\infty$. Then in $A_{s-1}$ we have $B_{s-1} \\geq W_{s-1}, b_{s-1} \\geq w_{s-1}>1$ as $s-1 \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}$. Now, if $s=f$, then in $A_{s-1}$, there is no $1-\\mathrm{w}$-string as well as no $(>2)$-b-string. That is, $2=B_{s-1} \\geq W_{s-1} \\geq b_{s-1} \\geq w_{s-1}>1$, hence all these numbers equal 2 . This means that in $A_{s-1}$, all strings contain 2 pearls, and there are $2^{s-1}$ black and $2^{s-1}$ white strings, which means $b=2 \\cdot 2^{s-1}=w$. This contradicts the problem conditions.\n\nHence we have $s \\leq f-1$ and thus $s \\leq t$. Therefore, in the $s$ th step each string is cut into two parts. Now, if a 1-b-string appears in this step, then from $w_{s-1} \\leq b_{s-1}$ we see that a 1-w-string appears as well; so, in each case in the sth step a 1-w-string appears, while not all black pearls become single, as desired.\n\nCase 2. Now assume that $t+1 \\leq s$ and $t+2 \\leq f$. Then in $A_{t}$ we have exactly $2^{t}$ white and $2^{t}$ black strings, all being larger than 1 , and $2^{t+1}>k \\geq 2^{t}$ (the latter holds since $2^{t}$ is the total number of strings in $\\left.A_{t-1}\\right)$. Now, in the $(t+1)$ st step, exactly $k$ strings are cut, not more than $2^{t}$ of them being black; so the number of w-strings in $A_{t+1}$ is at least $2^{t}+\\left(k-2^{t}\\right)=k$. Since the number of w-strings does not decrease in our process, in $A_{f-1}$ we have at least $k$ white strings as well.\n\nFinally, in $A_{f-1}$, all b-strings are not larger than 2, and at least one 2-b-string is cut in the $f$ th step. Therefore, at most $k-1$ white strings are cut in this step, hence there exists a w-string $\\mathcal{W}$ which is not cut in the $f$ th step. On the other hand, since a 2 -b-string is cut, all $(\\geq 2)$-w-strings should also be cut in the $f$ th step; hence $\\mathcal{W}$ should be a single pearl. This is exactly what we needed.",
            "We use the same notations as introduced in the first paragraph of the previous solution. We claim that at every stage, there exist a $u$-b-string and a $v$-w-string such that either\n\n(i) $u>v \\geq 1$, or\n\n(ii) $2 \\leq u \\leq v<2 u$, and there also exist $k-1$ of $(>v / 2)$-strings other than considered above.\n\nFirst, we notice that this statement implies the problem statement. Actually, in both cases (i) and (ii) we have $u>1$, so at each stage there exists a $(\\geq 2)$-b-string, and for the last stage it is exactly what we need.\n\nNow, we prove the claim by induction on the number of the stage. Obviously, for $A_{0}$ the condition (i) holds since $b>w$. Further, we suppose that the statement holds for $A_{i}$, and prove it for $A_{i+1}$. Two cases are possible.\n\nCase 1. Assume that in $A_{i}$, there are a $u$-b-string and a $v$-w-string with $u>v$. We can assume that $v$ is the length of the shortest w-string in $A_{i}$; since we are not at the final stage, we have $v \\geq 2$. Now, in the $(i+1)$ st step, two subcases may occur.\n\nSubcase 1a. Suppose that either no $u$-b-string is cut, or both some $u$-b-string and some $v$-w-string are cut. Then in $A_{i+1}$, we have either a $u$-b-string and a $(\\leq v)$-w-string (and (i) is valid), or we have a $\\lceil u / 2\\rceil$-b-string and a $\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$-w-string. In the latter case, from $u>v$ we get $\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$, and (i) is valid again.\n\nSubcase 1b. Now, some $u$-b-string is cut, and no $v$-w-string is cut (and hence all the strings which are cut are longer than $v$ ). If $u^{\\prime}=\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>v$, then the condition (i) is satisfied since we have a $u^{\\prime}$-b-string and a $v$-w-string in $A_{i+1}$. Otherwise, notice that the inequality $u>v \\geq 2$ implies $u^{\\prime} \\geq 2$. Furthermore, besides a fixed $u$-b-string, other $k-1$ of $(\\geq v+1)$-strings should be cut in the $(i+1)$ st step, hence providing at least $k-1$ of $(\\geq\\lceil(v+1) / 2\\rceil)$-strings, and $\\lceil(v+1) / 2\\rceil>v / 2$. So, we can put $v^{\\prime}=v$, and we have $u^{\\prime} \\leq v<u \\leq 2 u^{\\prime}$, so the condition (ii) holds for $A_{i+1}$.\n\nCase 2. Conversely, assume that in $A_{i}$ there exist a $u$-b-string, a $v$-w-string $(2 \\leq u \\leq v<2 u)$ and a set $S$ of $k-1$ other strings larger than $v / 2$ (and hence larger than 1 ). In the $(i+1)$ st step, three subcases may occur.\n\nSubcase 2a. Suppose that some $u$-b-string is not cut, and some $v$-w-string is cut. The latter one results in a $\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$-w-string, we have $v^{\\prime}=\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor<u$, and the condition (i) is valid.\n\n\n\nSubcase 2b. Next, suppose that no $v$-w-string is cut (and therefore no $u$-b-string is cut as $u \\leq v)$. Then all $k$ strings which are cut have the length $>v$, so each one results in a $(>v / 2)$ string. Hence in $A_{i+1}$, there exist $k \\geq k-1$ of $(>v / 2)$-strings other than the considered $u$ - and $v$-strings, and the condition (ii) is satisfied.\n\nSubcase 2c. In the remaining case, all $u$-b-strings are cut. This means that all $(\\geq u)$-strings are cut as well, hence our $v$-w-string is cut. Therefore in $A_{i+1}$ there exists a $[u / 2]$-b-string together with a $\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$-w-string. Now, if $u^{\\prime}=\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor=v^{\\prime}$ then the condition (i) is fulfilled. Otherwise, we have $u^{\\prime} \\leq v^{\\prime}<u \\leq 2 u^{\\prime}$. In this case, we show that $u^{\\prime} \\geq 2$. If, to the contrary, $u^{\\prime}=1$ (and hence $u=2$ ), then all black and white $(\\geq 2)$-strings should be cut in the $(i+1)$ st step, and among these strings there are at least a $u$-b-string, a $v$-w-string, and $k-1$ strings in $S$ ( $k+1$ strings altogether). This is impossible.\n\nHence, we get $2 \\leq u^{\\prime} \\leq v^{\\prime}<2 u^{\\prime}$. To reach (ii), it remains to check that in $A_{i+1}$, there exists a set $S^{\\prime}$ of $k-1$ other strings larger than $v^{\\prime} / 2$. These will be exactly the strings obtained from the elements of $S$. Namely, each $s \\in S$ was either cut in the $(i+1)$ st step, or not. In the former case, let us include into $S^{\\prime}$ the largest of the strings obtained from $s$; otherwise we include $s$ itself into $S^{\\prime}$. All $k-1$ strings in $S^{\\prime}$ are greater than $v / 2 \\geq v^{\\prime}$, as desired."

Our aim is to find a point that is not covered by $L_{1}, \\ldots, L_{s}$.\n\nThe idea of the proof is the following. Imagine that we expand each subgrid to some maximal subgrid so that for the $i$ th axis, there will be at most $n_{i}-1$ maximal subgrids orthogonal to this axis. Then the desired point can be found easily: its $i$ th coordinate should be that not covered by the maximal subgrids orthogonal to the $i$ th axis. Surely, the conditions for existence of such expansion are provided by Hall's lemma on matchings. So, we will follow this direction, although we will apply Hall's lemma to some subgraph instead of the whole graph.\n\nConstruct a bipartite graph $G=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E\\right)$ as follows. Let $V=\\left\\{L_{1}, \\ldots, L_{s}\\right\\}$, and let $V^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i j}: 1 \\leq i \\leq s, 1 \\leq j \\leq n_{i}-1\\right\\}$ be some set of $s^{\\prime}$ elements. Further, let the edge $\\left(L_{m}, v_{i j}\\right)$ appear iff $L_{m}$ is orthogonal to the $i$ th axis.\n\nFor each subset $W \\subset V$, denote\n\n$$\nf(W)=\\left\\{v \\in V^{\\prime}:(L, v) \\in E \\text { for some } L \\in W\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNotice that $f(V)=V^{\\prime}$ by (iii).\n\nNow, consider the set $W \\subset V$ containing the maximal number of elements such that $|W|>$ $|f(W)|$; if there is no such set then we set $W=\\varnothing$. Denote $W^{\\prime}=f(W), U=V \\backslash W, U^{\\prime}=V^{\\prime} \\backslash W^{\\prime}$.\n\n\n\nBy our assumption and the Lemma condition, $|f(V)|=\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq|V|$, hence $W \\neq V$ and $U \\neq \\varnothing$. Permuting the coordinates, we can assume that $U^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i j}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell\\right\\}, W^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i j}: \\ell+1 \\leq i \\leq k\\right\\}$.\n\nConsider the induced subgraph $G^{\\prime}$ of $G$ on the vertices $U \\cup U^{\\prime}$. We claim that for every $X \\subset U$, we get $\\left|f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq|X|$ (so $G^{\\prime}$ satisfies the conditions of Hall's lemma). Actually, we have $|W| \\geq|f(W)|$, so if $|X|>\\left|f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right|$ for some $X \\subset U$, then we have\n\n$$\n|W \\cup X|=|W|+|X|>|f(W)|+\\left|f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right|=\\left|f(W) \\cup\\left(f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=|f(W \\cup X)|\n$$\n\nThis contradicts the maximality of $|W|$.\n\nThus, applying Hall's lemma, we can assign to each $L \\in U$ some vertex $v_{i j} \\in U^{\\prime}$ so that to distinct elements of $U$, distinct vertices of $U^{\\prime}$ are assigned. In this situation, we say that $L \\in U$ corresponds to the $i$ th axis, and write $g(L)=i$. Since there are $n_{i}-1$ vertices of the form $v_{i j}$, we get that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$, not more than $n_{i}-1$ subgrids correspond to the $i$ th axis.\n\nFinally, we are ready to present the desired point. Since $W \\neq V$, there exists a point $b=\\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right) \\in N \\backslash\\left(\\cup_{L \\in W} L\\right)$. On the other hand, for every $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$, consider any subgrid $L \\in U$ with $g(L)=i$. This means exactly that $L$ is orthogonal to the $i$ th axis, and hence all its elements have the same $i$ th coordinate $c_{L}$. Since there are at most $n_{i}-1$ such subgrids, there exists a number $0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1$ which is not contained in a set $\\left\\{c_{L}: g(L)=i\\right\\}$. Choose such number for every $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$. Now we claim that point $a=\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{\\ell}, b_{\\ell+1}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right)$ is not covered, hence contradicting the Lemma condition.\n\nSurely, point $a$ cannot lie in some $L \\in U$, since all the points in $L$ have $g(L)$ th coordinate $c_{L} \\neq a_{g(L)}$. On the other hand, suppose that $a \\in L$ for some $L \\in W$; recall that $b \\notin L$. But the points $a$ and $b$ differ only at first $\\ell$ coordinates, so $L$ should be orthogonal to at least one of the first $\\ell$ axes, and hence our graph contains some edge $\\left(L, v_{i j}\\right)$ for $i \\leq \\ell$. It contradicts the definition of $W^{\\prime}$. The Lemma is proved.\n\nNow we turn to the problem. Let $d_{j}$ be the step of the progression $P_{j}$. Note that since $n=$ l.c.m. $\\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{s}\\right)$, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ there exists an index $j(i)$ such that $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid d_{j(i)}$. We assume that $n>1$; otherwise the problem statement is trivial.\n\nFor each $0 \\leq m \\leq n-1$ and $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, let $m_{i}$ be the residue of $m$ modulo $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}$, and let $m_{i}=\\overline{r_{i \\alpha_{i}} \\ldots r_{i 1}}$ be the base $p_{i}$ representation of $m_{i}$ (possibly, with some leading zeroes). Now, we put into correspondence to $m$ the sequence $r(m)=\\left(r_{11}, \\ldots, r_{1 \\alpha_{1}}, r_{21}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}\\right)$. Hence $r(m)$ lies in a $\\underbrace{p_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{1}}_{\\alpha_{1} \\text { times }} \\times \\cdots \\times \\underbrace{p_{k} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}}_{\\alpha_{k} \\text { times }} \\operatorname{grid} N$.\n\nSurely, if $r(m)=r\\left(m^{\\prime}\\right)$ then $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid m_{i}-m_{i}^{\\prime}$, which follows $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid m-m^{\\prime}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$; consequently, $n \\mid m-m^{\\prime}$. So, when $m$ runs over the set $\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, the sequences $r(m)$ do not repeat; since $|N|=n$, this means that $r$ is a bijection between $\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ and $N$. Now we will show that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq s$, the set $L_{i}=\\left\\{r(m): m \\in P_{i}\\right\\}$ is a subgrid, and that for each axis there exists a subgrid orthogonal to this axis. Obviously, these subgrids cover $N$, and the condition (ii') follows directly from (ii). Hence the Lemma provides exactly the estimate we need.\n\nConsider some $1 \\leq j \\leq s$ and let $d_{j}=p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. Consider some $q \\in P_{j}$ and let $r(q)=$ $\\left(r_{11}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}\\right)$. Then for an arbitrary $q^{\\prime}$, setting $r\\left(q^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(r_{11}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}^{\\prime}\\right)$ we have\n\n$$\nq^{\\prime} \\in P_{j} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad p_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}} \\mid q-q^{\\prime} \\text { for each } 1 \\leq i \\leq k \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\\prime} \\text { for all } t \\leq \\gamma_{i} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nHence $L_{j}=\\left\\{\\left(r_{11}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in N: r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\\prime}\\right.$ for all $\\left.t \\leq \\gamma_{i}\\right\\}$ which means that $L_{j}$ is a subgrid containing $r(q)$. Moreover, in $L_{j(i)}$, all the coordinates corresponding to $p_{i}$ are fixed, so it is orthogonal to all of their axes, as desired.",
            "We start with introducing some notation. For positive integer $r$, we denote $[r]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, r\\}$. Next, we say that a set of progressions $\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}$ cover $\\mathbb{Z}$ if each integer belongs to some of them; we say that this covering is minimal if no proper subset of $\\mathcal{P}$ covers $\\mathbb{Z}$. Obviously, each covering contains a minimal subcovering.\n\nNext, for a minimal covering $\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}$ and for every $1 \\leq i \\leq s$, let $d_{i}$ be the step of progression $P_{i}$, and $h_{i}$ be some number which is contained in $P_{i}$ but in none of the other progressions. We assume that $n>1$, otherwise the problem is trivial. This implies $d_{i}>1$, otherwise the progression $P_{i}$ covers all the numbers, and $n=1$.\n\nWe will prove a more general statement, namely the following\n\nClaim. Assume that the progressions $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}$ and number $n=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\alpha_{k}}>1$ are chosen as in the problem statement. Moreover, choose some nonempty set of indices $I=\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{t}\\right\\} \\subseteq[k]$ and some positive integer $\\beta_{i} \\leq \\alpha_{i}$ for every $i \\in I$. Consider the set of indices\n\n$$\nT=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta_{i}+1} \\mid d_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I\\right\\} .\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n|T| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_{i}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nObserve that the Claim for $I=[k]$ and $\\beta_{i}=\\alpha_{i}$ implies the problem statement, since the left-hand side in (2) is not greater than $s$. Hence, it suffices to prove the Claim.\n\n1. First, we prove the Claim assuming that all $d_{j}$ 's are prime numbers. If for some $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ we have at least $p_{i}$ progressions with the step $p_{i}$, then they do not intersect and hence cover all the integers; it means that there are no other progressions, and $n=p_{i}$; the Claim is trivial in this case.\n\nNow assume that for every $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, there are not more than $p_{i}-1$ progressions with step $p_{i}$; each such progression covers the numbers with a fixed residue modulo $p_{i}$, therefore there exists a residue $q_{i} \\bmod p_{i}$ which is not touched by these progressions. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a number $q$ such that $q \\equiv q_{i}\\left(\\bmod p_{i}\\right)$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$; this number cannot be covered by any progression with step $p_{i}$, hence it is not covered at all. A contradiction.\n\n\n\n2. Now, we assume that the general Claim is not valid, and hence we consider a counterexample $\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}$ for the Claim; we can choose it to be minimal in the following sense:\n\n- the number $n$ is minimal possible among all the counterexamples; of $n$.\n- the sum $\\sum_{i} d_{i}$ is minimal possible among all the counterexamples having the chosen value\n\nAs was mentioned above, not all numbers $d_{i}$ are primes; hence we can assume that $d_{1}$ is composite, say $p_{1} \\mid d_{1}$ and $d_{1}^{\\prime}=\\frac{d_{1}}{p_{1}}>1$. Consider a progression $P_{1}^{\\prime}$ having the step $d_{1}^{\\prime}$, and containing $P_{1}$. We will focus on two coverings constructed as follows.\n\n(i) Surely, the progressions $P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s}$ cover $\\mathbb{Z}$, though this covering in not necessarily minimal. So, choose some minimal subcovering $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ in it; surely $P_{1}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ since $h_{1}$ is not covered by $P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s}$, so we may assume that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ for some $s^{\\prime} \\leq s$. Furthermore, the period of the covering $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ can appear to be less than $n$; so we denote this period by\n\n$$\nn^{\\prime}=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}-\\sigma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\alpha_{k}-\\sigma_{k}}=\\text { l.c.m. }\\left(d_{1}^{\\prime}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{s^{\\prime}}\\right)\n$$\n\nObserve that for each $P_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$, we have $h_{j} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}$, otherwise $h_{j}$ would not be covered by $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n(ii) On the other hand, each nonempty set of the form $R_{i}=P_{i} \\cap P_{1}^{\\prime}(1 \\leq i \\leq s)$ is also a progression with a step $r_{i}=$ l.c.m. $\\left(d_{i}, d_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$, and such sets cover $P_{1}^{\\prime}$. Scaling these progressions with the ratio $1 / d_{1}^{\\prime}$, we obtain the progressions $Q_{i}$ with steps $q_{i}=r_{i} / d_{1}^{\\prime}$ which cover $\\mathbb{Z}$. Now we choose a minimal subcovering $\\mathcal{Q}$ of this covering; again we should have $Q_{1} \\in \\mathcal{Q}$ by the reasons of $h_{1}$. Now, denote the period of $\\mathcal{Q}$ by\n\n$$\nn^{\\prime \\prime}=\\text { l.c.m. }\\left\\{q_{i}: Q_{i} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\right\\}=\\frac{\\text { l.c.m. }\\left\\{r_{i}: Q_{i} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\right\\}}{d_{1}^{\\prime}}=\\frac{p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}}{d_{1}^{\\prime}} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nNote that if $h_{j} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}$, then the image of $h_{j}$ under the scaling can be covered by $Q_{j}$ only; so, in this case we have $Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}$.\n\nOur aim is to find the desired number of progressions in coverings $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$. First, we have $n \\geq n^{\\prime}$, and the sum of the steps in $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is less than that in $\\mathcal{P}$; hence the Claim is valid for $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. We apply it to the set of indices $I^{\\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in I: \\beta_{i}>\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}$ and the exponents $\\beta_{i}^{\\prime}=\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}$; hence the set under consideration is\n\n$$\nT^{\\prime}=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s^{\\prime}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\left(\\alpha_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)-\\beta_{i}^{\\prime}+1}=p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta_{i}+1} \\mid d_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\subseteq T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right] \\text {, }\n$$\n\nand we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\left|T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\\right| \\geq\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I^{\\prime}}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)=1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)_{+}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $(x)_{+}=\\max \\{x, 0\\}$; the latter equality holds as for $i \\notin I^{\\prime}$ we have $\\beta_{i} \\leq \\sigma_{i}$.\n\nObserve that $x=(x-y)_{+}+\\min \\{x, y\\}$ for all $x, y$. So, if we find at least\n\n$$\nG=\\sum_{i \\in I} \\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nindices in $T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}$, then we would have\n\n$|T|=\\left|T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\\right|+\\left|T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)_{+}+\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\right)\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)=1+\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_{i}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)$,\n\nthus leading to a contradiction with the choice of $\\mathcal{P}$. We will find those indices among the indices of progressions in $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n\n\n\n3. Now denote $I^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in I: \\sigma_{i}>0\\right\\}$ and consider some $i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}$; then $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\nmid n^{\\prime}.$. On the other hand, there exists an index $j(i)$ such that $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid d_{j(i)}$; this means that $d_{j(i)} \\nmid n^{\\prime}$ and hence $P_{j(i)}$ cannot appear in $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$, so $j(i)>s^{\\prime}$. Moreover, we have observed before that in this case $h_{j(i)} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}$, hence $Q_{j(i)} \\in \\mathcal{Q}$. This means that $q_{j(i)} \\mid n^{\\prime \\prime}$, therefore $\\gamma_{i}=\\alpha_{i}$ for each $i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}$ (recall here that $q_{i}=r_{i} / d_{1}^{\\prime}$ and hence $\\left.d_{j(i)}\\left|r_{j(i)}\\right| d_{1}^{\\prime} n^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$.\n\nLet $d_{1}^{\\prime}=p_{1}^{\\tau_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\tau_{k}}$. Then $n^{\\prime \\prime}=p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}-\\tau_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}}$. Now, if $i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}$, then for every $\\beta$ the condition $p_{i}^{\\left(\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}\\right)-\\beta+1} \\mid q_{j}$ is equivalent to $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta+1} \\mid r_{j}$.\n\nNote that $n^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq n / d_{1}^{\\prime}<n$, hence we can apply the Claim to the covering $\\mathcal{Q}$. We perform this with the set of indices $I^{\\prime \\prime}$ and the exponents $\\beta_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}>0$. So, the set under consideration is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT^{\\prime \\prime} & =\\left\\{j: Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\left(\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}\\right)-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid q_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{j: Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid r_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\},\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand we obtain $\\left|T^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq 1+G$. Finally, we claim that $T^{\\prime \\prime} \\subseteq T \\cap\\left(\\{1\\} \\cup\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right)$; then we will obtain $\\left|T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right| \\geq G$, which is exactly what we need.\n\nTo prove this, consider any $j \\in T^{\\prime \\prime}$. Observe first that $\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1>\\alpha_{i}-\\sigma_{i} \\geq \\tau_{i}$, hence from $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid r_{j}=$ l.c.m. $\\left(d_{1}^{\\prime}, d_{j}\\right)$ we have $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid d_{j}$, which means that $j \\in T$. Next, the exponent of $p_{i}$ in $d_{j}$ is greater than that in $n^{\\prime}$, which means that $P_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. This may appear only if $j=1$ or $j>s^{\\prime}$, as desired. This completes the proof."

Next, $\\angle I Y X>\\angle Z Y X=60^{\\circ}$, but $\\angle I Y X<\\angle I Y B_{1}$, since $Y B_{1}$ is a tangent and $Y X$ is a secant line to circle $\\omega$ from point $Y$. Hence, we get $120^{\\circ}<\\angle I Y B_{1}+\\angle I Y X=$ $\\angle B_{1} Y X=\\angle Y X C+\\angle Y C X<30^{\\circ}+\\angle Y C X$, hence $\\angle Y C X>120^{\\circ}-30^{\\circ}=90^{\\circ}$, as desired."

            "We will show that if a pair $(a, b)$ is $2010-\\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}$-good for all positive integer $i$.\n\nClaim 1. If $(a, b)$ is $2010-\\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.\n\nProof. Assume that $P(m)=P(k)(\\bmod 67)$. Since 67 and 30 are coprime, there exist integers $m^{\\prime}$ and $k^{\\prime}$ such that $k^{\\prime} \\equiv k(\\bmod 67), k^{\\prime} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 30)$, and $m^{\\prime} \\equiv m(\\bmod 67), m^{\\prime} \\equiv 0$ $(\\bmod 30)$.

Therefore, $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.\n\nClaim 2. If $(a, b)$ is 67 -good then $67 \\mid a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $67 \\nmid a$. Consider the sets $\\left\\{a t^{2}(\\bmod 67): 0 \\leq t \\leq 33\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{-3 a s^{2}-b\\right.$ $\\bmod 67: 0 \\leq s \\leq 33\\}$. Since $a \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)$, each of these sets has 34 elements. Hence they have at least one element in common. If $a t^{2} \\equiv-3 a s^{2}-b(\\bmod 67)$ then for $m=t \\pm s, k=\\mp 2 s$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(m)-P(k)=a\\left(m^{3}-k^{3}\\right)+b(m-k) & =(m-k)\\left(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\right) \\\\\n& =(t \\pm 3 s)\\left(a t^{2}+3 a s^{2}+b\\right) \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 67)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $(a, b)$ is 67 -good, we must have $m \\equiv k(\\bmod 67)$ in both cases, that is, $t \\equiv 3 s(\\bmod 67)$ and $t \\equiv-3 s(\\bmod 67)$. This means $t \\equiv s \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)$ and $b \\equiv-3 a s^{2}-a t^{2} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)$. But then $67 \\mid P(7)-P(2)=67 \\cdot 5 a+5 b$ and $67 / 17-2$, contradicting that $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.\n\nClaim 3. If $(a, b)$ is $2010-\\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}-\\operatorname{good}$ all $i \\geq 1$.\n\nProof. By Claim 2 , we have $67 \\mid a$. If $67 \\mid b$, then $P(x) \\equiv P(0)(\\bmod 67)$ for all $x$, contradicting that $(a, b)$ is 67 -good. Hence, $67 /\\langle b$.\n\nSuppose that $67^{i} \\mid P(m)-P(k)=(m-k)\\left(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\right)$. Since $67 \\mid a$ and $67 \\not \\nmid b$, the second factor $a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b$ is coprime to 67 and hence $67^{i} \\mid m-k$. Therefore, $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}$-good."

(The indices of the cells in a row are considered modulo $2^{n}$.)\n\nProve that the maximal possible number of colors is $2^{n}$.",
        "solution": [
            "Throughout the solution we denote the cells of the table by coordinate pairs; $(i, j)$ refers to the $j$ th cell in the $i$ th row.\n\nConsider the directed graph, whose vertices are the cells of the board, and the edges are the arrows $(i, j) \\rightarrow(j, i+j)$ for all $0 \\leq i, j \\leq 2^{n}-1$. From each vertex $(i, j)$, exactly one edge passes (to $\\left(j, i+j \\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ ); conversely, to each cell $(j, k)$ exactly one edge is directed (from the cell $\\left.\\left(k-j \\bmod 2^{n}, j\\right)\\right)$. Hence, the graph splits into cycles.\n\nNow, in any coloring considered, the vertices of each cycle should have the same color by the problem condition. On the other hand, if each cycle has its own color, the obtained coloring obviously satisfies the problem conditions. Thus, the maximal possible number of colors is the same as the number of cycles, and we have to prove that this number is $2^{n}$.\n\nNext, consider any cycle $\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right), \\ldots$; we will describe it in other terms. Define a sequence $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ by the relations $a_{0}=i_{1}, a_{1}=j_{1}, a_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1}$ for all $n \\geq 1$ (we say that such a sequence is a Fibonacci-type sequence). Then an obvious induction shows that $i_{k} \\equiv a_{k-1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), j_{k} \\equiv a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$. Hence we need to investigate the behavior of Fibonacci-type sequences modulo $2^{n}$.\n\nDenote by $F_{0}, F_{1}, \\ldots$ the Fibonacci numbers defined by $F_{0}=0, F_{1}=1$, and $F_{n+2}=$ $F_{n+1}+F_{n}$ for $n \\geq 0$. We also set $F_{-1}=1$ according to the recurrence relation.\n\nFor every positive integer $m$, denote by $\\nu(m)$ the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of $m$, i.e. for which $2^{\\nu(m)} \\mid m$ but $2^{\\nu(m)+1} \\mid\\langle m$.\n\nLemma 1. For every Fibonacci-type sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots$, and every $k \\geq 0$, we have $a_{k}=$ $F_{k-1} a_{0}+F_{k} a_{1}$.\n\nProof. Apply induction on $k$. The base cases $k=0,1$ are trivial. For the step, from the induction hypothesis we get\n\n$$\na_{k+1}=a_{k}+a_{k-1}=\\left(F_{k-1} a_{0}+F_{k} a_{1}\\right)+\\left(F_{k-2} a_{0}+F_{k-1} a_{1}\\right)=F_{k} a_{0}+F_{k+1} a_{1}\n$$\n\nLemma 2. For every $m \\geq 3$,\n\n(a) we have $\\nu\\left(F_{3 \\cdot 2^{m-2}}\\right)=m$;\n\n(b) $d=3 \\cdot 2^{m-2}$ is the least positive index for which $2^{m} \\mid F_{d}$;\n\n(c) $F_{3 \\cdot 2^{m-2}+1} \\equiv 1+2^{m-1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{m}\\right)$.\n\nProof. Apply induction on $m$. In the base case $m=3$ we have $\\nu\\left(F_{3 \\cdot 2^{m-2}}\\right)=F_{6}=8$, so $\\nu\\left(F_{3 \\cdot 2^{m-2}}\\right)=\\nu(8)=3$, the preceding Fibonacci-numbers are not divisible by 8 , and indeed $F_{3 \\cdot 2^{m-2}+1}=F_{7}=13 \\equiv 1+4(\\bmod 8)$.\n\nNow suppose that $m>3$ and let $k=3 \\cdot 2^{m-3}$. By applying Lemma 1 to the Fibonacci-type sequence $F_{k}, F_{k+1}, \\ldots$ we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nF_{2 k}=F_{k-1} F_{k}+F_{k} F_{k+1}=\\left(F_{k+1}-F_{k}\\right) F_{k}+F_{k+1} F_{k}=2 F_{k+1} F_{k}-F_{k}^{2}, \\\\\nF_{2 k+1}=F_{k} \\cdot F_{k}+F_{k+1} \\cdot F_{k+1}=F_{k}^{2}+F_{k+1}^{2} .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, $\\nu\\left(F_{k}\\right)=m-1$, and $F_{k+1}$ is odd. Therefore we get $\\nu\\left(F_{k}^{2}\\right)=$ $2(m-1)>(m-1)+1=\\nu\\left(2 F_{k} F_{k+1}\\right)$, which implies $\\nu\\left(F_{2 k}\\right)=m$, establishing statement (a).\n\n\n\nMoreover, since $F_{k+1}=1+2^{m-2}+a 2^{m-1}$ for some integer $a$, we get\n\n$$\nF_{2 k+1}=F_{k}^{2}+F_{k+1}^{2} \\equiv 0+\\left(1+2^{m-2}+a 2^{m-1}\\right)^{2} \\equiv 1+2^{m-1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{m}\\right)\n$$\n\nas desired in statement (c).\n\nWe are left to prove that $2^{m} \\nmid F_{\\ell}$ for $\\ell<2 k$. Assume the contrary. Since $2^{m-1} \\mid F_{\\ell}$, from the induction hypothesis it follows that $\\ell>k$. But then we have $F_{\\ell}=F_{k-1} F_{\\ell-k}+F_{k} F_{\\ell-k+1}$, where the second summand is divisible by $2^{m-1}$ but the first one is not (since $F_{k-1}$ is odd and $\\ell-k<k)$. Hence the sum is not divisible even by $2^{m-1}$. A contradiction.\n\nNow, for every pair of integers $(a, b) \\neq(0,0)$, let $\\mu(a, b)=\\min \\{\\nu(a), \\nu(b)\\}$. By an obvious induction, for every Fibonacci-type sequence $A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ we have $\\mu\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}\\right)=\\mu\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\\right)=\\ldots$; denote this common value by $\\mu(A)$. Also denote by $p_{n}(A)$ the period of this sequence modulo $2^{n}$, that is, the least $p>0$ such that $a_{k+p} \\equiv a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ for all $k \\geq 0$.\n\nLemma 3. Let $A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ be a Fibonacci-type sequence such that $\\mu(A)=k<n$. Then $p_{n}(A)=3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}$.\n\nProof. First, we note that the sequence $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ has period $p$ modulo $2^{n}$ if and only if the sequence $\\left(a_{0} / 2^{k}, a_{1} / 2^{k}, \\ldots\\right)$ has period $p$ modulo $2^{n-k}$. Hence, passing to this sequence we can assume that $k=0$\n\nWe prove the statement by induction on $n$. It is easy to see that for $n=1,2$ the claim is true; actually, each Fibonacci-type sequence $A$ with $\\mu(A)=0$ behaves as $0,1,1,0,1,1, \\ldots$ modulo 2 , and as $0,1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1, \\ldots$ modulo 4 (all pairs of residues from which at least one is odd appear as a pair of consecutive terms in this sequence).\n\nNow suppose that $n \\geq 3$ and consider an arbitrary Fibonacci-type sequence $A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ with $\\mu(A)=0$. Obviously we should have $p_{n-1}(A) \\mid p_{n}(A)$, or, using the induction hypothesis, $s=3 \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\mid p_{n}(A)$. Next, we may suppose that $a_{0}$ is even; hence $a_{1}$ is odd, and $a_{0}=2 b_{0}$, $a_{1}=2 b_{1}+1$ for some integers $b_{0}, b_{1}$.\n\nConsider the Fibonacci-type sequence $B=\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ starting with $\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}\\right)$. Since $a_{0}=$ $2 b_{0}+F_{0}, a_{1}=2 b_{1}+F_{1}$, by an easy induction we get $a_{k}=2 b_{k}+F_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 0$. By the induction hypothesis, we have $p_{n-1}(B) \\mid s$, hence the sequence $\\left(2 b_{0}, 2 b_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ is $s$-periodic modulo $2^{n}$. On the other hand, by Lemma 2 we have $F_{s+1} \\equiv 1+2^{n-1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), F_{2 s} \\equiv 0$ $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), F_{2 s+1} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$, hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\na_{s+1}=2 b_{s+1}+F_{s+1} \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1+2^{n-1} \\not \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \\\\\na_{2 s}=2 b_{2 s}+F_{2 s} \\equiv 2 b_{0}+0=a_{0} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \\\\\na_{2 s+1}=2 b_{2 s+1}+F_{2 s+1} \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe first line means that $A$ is not s-periodic, while the other two provide that $a_{2 s} \\equiv a_{0}$, $a_{2 s+1} \\equiv a_{1}$ and hence $a_{2 s+t} \\equiv a_{t}$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Hence $s\\left|p_{n}(A)\\right| 2 s$ and $p_{n}(A) \\neq s$, which means that $p_{n}(A)=2 s$, as desired.\n\nFinally, Lemma 3 provides a straightforward method of counting the number of cycles. Actually, take any number $0 \\leq k \\leq n-1$ and consider all the cells $(i, j)$ with $\\mu(i, j)=k$. The total number of such cells is $2^{2(n-k)}-2^{2(n-k-1)}=3 \\cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}$. On the other hand, they are split into cycles, and by Lemma 3 the length of each cycle is $3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}$. Hence the number of cycles consisting of these cells is exactly $\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}}{3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}=2^{n-k-1}$. Finally, there is only one cell $(0,0)$ which is not mentioned in the previous computation, and it forms a separate cycle. So the total number of cycles is\n\n$$\n1+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^{n-1-k}=1+\\left(1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{n-1}\\right)=2^{n}\n$$"

In the sequel, we denote the pairs in $S$ by $\\left(a_{J}, b_{J}\\right)$, where $J$ is a finite subset of the set $\\mathbb{N}$ of positive integers and $a_{J}=\\sum_{j \\in J} c_{j}, b_{J}=\\sum_{j \\in J} c_{j-1}$. Since $\\psi a_{J}+b_{J}=\\sum_{j \\in J}\\left(c_{j} \\psi+c_{j-1}\\right)$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\psi a_{J}+b_{J}=\\sum_{j \\in J} \\psi^{j-1} \\quad \\text { for each }\\left(a_{J}, b_{J}\\right) \\in S \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, in view of $-1<\\psi<0$,\n\n$$\n-1=\\frac{\\psi}{1-\\psi^{2}}=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\psi^{2 j+1}<\\sum_{j \\in J} \\psi^{j-1}<\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\psi^{2 j}=\\frac{1}{1-\\psi^{2}}=1-\\psi=\\varphi\n$$\n\nTherefore, according to (1),\n\n$$\n-1<\\psi a_{J}+b_{J}<\\varphi \\quad \\text { for each }\\left(a_{J}, b_{J}\\right) \\in S\n$$\n\nThus $m=-1$ and $M=\\varphi$ is an appropriate choice.\n\nConversely, we prove that if an ordered pair of nonnegative integers $(x, y)$ satisfies the inequality $-1<\\psi x+y<\\varphi$ then $(x, y) \\in S$.\n\n\n\nLemma. Let $x, y$ be nonnegative integers such that $-1<\\psi x+y<\\varphi$. Then there exists a subset $J$ of $\\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{j \\in J} \\psi^{j-1} \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. For $x=y=0$ it suffices to choose the empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ as $J$, so let at least one of $x, y$ be nonzero. There exist representations of $\\psi x+y$ of the form\n\n$$\n\\psi x+y=\\psi^{i_{1}}+\\cdots+\\psi^{i_{k}}\n$$\n\nwhere $i_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq i_{k}$ is a sequence of nonnegative integers, not necessarily distinct. For instance, we can take $x$ summands $\\psi^{1}=\\psi$ and $y$ summands $\\psi^{0}=1$. Consider all such representations of minimum length $k$ and focus on the ones for which $i_{1}$ has the minimum possible value $j_{1}$. Among them, consider the representations where $i_{2}$ has the minimum possible value $j_{2}$. Upon choosing $j_{3}, \\ldots, j_{k}$ analogously, we obtain a sequence $j_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq j_{k}$ which clearly satisfies $\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}$. To prove the lemma, it suffices to show that $j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{k}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nSuppose on the contrary that $j_{r}=j_{r+1}$ for some $r=1, \\ldots, k-1$. Let us consider the case $j_{r} \\geq 2$ first. Observing that $2 \\psi^{2}=1+\\psi^{3}$, we replace $j_{r}$ and $j_{r+1}$ by $j_{r}-2$ and $j_{r}+1$, respectively. Since\n\n$$\n\\psi^{j_{r}}+\\psi^{j_{r+1}}=2 \\psi^{j_{r}}=\\psi^{j_{r}-2}\\left(1+\\psi^{3}\\right)=\\psi^{j_{r}-2}+\\psi^{j_{r}+1}\n$$\n\nthe new sequence also represents $\\psi x+y$ as needed, and the value of $i_{r}$ in it contradicts the minimum choice of $j_{r}$.\n\nLet $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0$. Then the sum $\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}$ contains at least two summands equal to $\\psi^{0}=1$. On the other hand $j_{s} \\neq 1$ for all $s$, because the equality $1+\\psi=\\psi^{2}$ implies that a representation of minimum length cannot contain consecutive $i_{r}$ 's. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}>2+\\psi^{3}+\\psi^{5}+\\psi^{7}+\\cdots=2-\\psi^{2}=\\varphi\n$$\n\ncontradicting the condition of the lemma.\n\nLet $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=1$; then $\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}$ contains at least two summands equal to $\\psi^{1}=\\psi$. Like in the case $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0$, we also infer that $j_{s} \\neq 0$ and $j_{s} \\neq 2$ for all $s$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}<2 \\psi+\\psi^{4}+\\psi^{6}+\\psi^{8}+\\cdots=2 \\psi-\\psi^{3}=-1\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction again. The conclusion follows.\n\nNow let the ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfy $-1<\\psi x+y<\\varphi$; hence the lemma applies to $(x, y)$. Let $J \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be such that (2) holds. Comparing (1) and (2), we conclude that $\\psi x+y=\\psi a_{J}+b_{J}$. Now, $x, y, a_{J}$ and $b_{J}$ are integers, and $\\psi$ is irrational. So the last equality implies $x=a_{J}$ and $y=b_{J}$. This shows that the numbers $\\alpha=\\psi, \\beta=1, m=-1, M=\\varphi$ meet the requirements."

Suppose it is subject to evolution as defined in the problem: the first (leftmost) term in a row depends only on the two first terms in the preceding row, according as they are equal or not. Now embed $C_{k}$ again in $A_{k}$. The 'leftmost' terms in the rows of $C_{k}$ now have neighbours on their left side - but these neighbours are their exact copies. Consequently the actual evolution within $C_{k}$ is the same, whether or not $C_{k}$ is considered as a piece of $A_{k+1}$ or in isolation. And since the top row of $C_{k}$ is $[1,0, \\ldots, 0]$, it follows that $C_{k}$ is identical with $A_{k}$.\n\n\n\nThe bottom row of $A_{k}$ is $[1,1, \\ldots, 1]$; the same is the bottom row of $C_{k}$, hence also of $B_{k}$, which mirrors $C_{k}$.

        "question": "A cake has the form of an $n \\times n$ square composed of $n^{2}$ unit squares. Strawberries lie on some of the unit squares so that each row or column contains exactly one strawberry; call this arrangement $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{B}$ be another such arrangement. Suppose that every grid rectangle with one vertex at the top left corner of the cake contains no fewer strawberries of arrangement $\\mathcal{B}$ than of arrangement $\\mathcal{A}$. Prove that arrangement $\\mathcal{B}$ can be obtained from $\\mathcal{A}$ by performing a number of switches, defined as follows:\n\nA switch consists in selecting a grid rectangle with only two strawberries, situated at its top right corner and bottom left corner, and moving these two strawberries to the other two corners of that rectangle.",
        "solution": [
            "We use capital letters to denote unit squares; $O$ is the top left corner square. For any two squares $X$ and $Y$ let $[X Y]$ be the smallest grid rectangle containing these two squares. Strawberries lie on some squares in arrangement $\\mathcal{A}$. Put a plum on each square of the target configuration $\\mathcal{B}$. For a square $X$ denote by $a(X)$ and $b(X)$ respectively the number of strawberries and the number of plums in $[O X]$. By hypothesis $a(X) \\leq b(X)$ for each $X$, with strict inequality for some $X$ (otherwise the two arrangements coincide and there is nothing to prove).\n\nThe idea is to show that by a legitimate switch one can obtain an arrangement $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}$ such that\n\n$$\na(X) \\leq a^{\\prime}(X) \\leq b(X) \\quad \\text { for each } X ; \\quad \\sum_{X} a(X)<\\sum_{X} a^{\\prime}(X) \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n(with $a^{\\prime}(X)$ defined analogously to $a(X)$; the sums range over all unit squares $X$ ). This will be enough because the same reasoning then applies to $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}$, giving rise to a new arrangement $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime \\prime}$, and so on (induction). Since $\\sum a(X)<\\sum a^{\\prime}(X)<\\sum a^{\\prime \\prime}(X)<\\ldots$ and all these sums do not exceed $\\sum b(X)$, we eventually obtain a sum with all summands equal to the respective $b(X) \\mathrm{s}$; all strawberries will meet with plums.\n\nConsider the uppermost row in which the plum and the strawberry lie on different squares $P$ and $S$ (respectively); clearly $P$ must be situated left to $S$. In the column passing through $P$, let $T$ be the top square and $B$ the bottom square. The strawberry in that column lies below the plum (because there is no plum in that column above $P$, and the positions of strawberries and plums coincide everywhere above the row of $P$ ). Hence there is at least one strawberry in the region $[B S]$ below $[P S]$. Let $V$ be the position of the uppermost strawberry in that region.\n\n<img_3817>\n\n\n\nDenote by $W$ the square at the intersection of the row through $V$ with the column through $S$ and let $R$ be the square vertex-adjacent to $W$ up-left. We claim that\n\n$$\na(X)<b(X) \\quad \\text { for all } \\quad X \\in[P R] \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nThis is so because if $X \\in[P R]$ then the portion of $[O X]$ left to column $[T B]$ contains at least as many plums as strawberries (the hypothesis of the problem); in the portion above the row through $P$ and $S$ we have perfect balance; and in the remaining portion, i.e. rectangle $[P X]$ we have a plum on square $P$ and no strawberry at all.\n\nNow we are able to perform the required switch. Let $U$ be the square at the intersection of the row through $P$ with the column through $V$ (some of $P, U, R$ can coincide). We move strawberries from squares $S$ and $V$ to squares $U$ and $W$. Then\n\n$$\na^{\\prime}(X)=a(X)+1 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad X \\in[U R] ; \\quad a^{\\prime}(X)=a(X) \\quad \\text { for other } X\n$$\n\nAnd since the rectangle $[U R]$ is contained in $[P R]$, we still have $a^{\\prime}(X) \\leq b(X)$ for all $S$, in view of (2); conditions (1) are satisfied and the proof is complete."

        "solution": [
            "For each $k$, denote by $t_{k}$ the unique integer such that $2^{t_{k}-1}<k+1 \\leq 2^{t_{k}}$. We show that an $(n, k)$-tournament exists if and only if $2^{t_{k}}$ divides $n$.\n\nFirst we prove that if $n=2^{t}$ for some $t$ then there is an $(n, k)$-tournament for all $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$. Let $S$ be the set of $0-1$ sequences with length $t$. We label the $2^{t}$ players with the elements of $S$ in an arbitrary fashion (which is possible as there are exactly $2^{t}$ sequences in $S$ ). Players are identified with their labels in the construction below. If $\\alpha, \\beta \\in S$, let $\\alpha+\\beta \\in S$ be the result of the modulo 2 term-by-term addition of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (with rules $0+0=0,0+1=1+0=1$, $1+1=0$; there is no carryover). For each $i=1, \\ldots, 2^{t}-1$ let $\\omega(i) \\in S$ be the sequence of base 2 digits of $i$, completed with leading zeros if necessary to achieve length $t$.\n\nNow define a tournament with $n=2^{t}$ players in $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$ rounds as follows: For all $i=1, \\ldots, k$, let player $\\alpha$ meet player $\\alpha+\\omega(i)$ in round $i$. The tournament is well-defined as $\\alpha+\\omega(i) \\in S$ and $\\alpha+\\omega(i)=\\beta+\\omega(i)$ implies $\\alpha=\\beta$; also $[\\alpha+\\omega(i)]+\\omega(i)=\\alpha$ for each $\\alpha \\in S$ (meaning that player $\\alpha+\\omega(i)$ meets player $\\alpha$ in round $i$, as needed). Each player plays in each round. Next, every two players meet at most once (exactly once if $k=2^{t}-1$ ), since $\\omega(i) \\neq \\omega(j)$ if $i \\neq j$. Thus condition (i) holds true, and condition (ii) is also easy to check.\n\nLet player $\\alpha$ meet player $\\beta$ in round $i$, player $\\gamma$ meet player $\\delta$ in round $i$, and player $\\alpha$ meet player $\\gamma$ in round $j$. Then $\\beta=\\alpha+\\omega(i), \\delta=\\gamma+\\omega(i)$ and $\\gamma=\\alpha+\\omega(j)$. By definition, $\\beta$ will play in round $j$ with\n\n$$\n\\beta+\\omega(j)=[\\alpha+\\omega(i)]+\\omega(j)=[\\alpha+\\omega(j)]+\\omega(i)=\\gamma+\\omega(i)=\\delta\n$$\n\nas required by (ii).\n\nSo there exists an $(n, k)$-tournament for pairs $(n, k)$ such that $n=2^{t}$ and $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$. The same conclusion is straightforward for $n$ of the form $n=2^{t} s$ and $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$. Indeed, consider $s$ different $\\left(2^{t}, k\\right)$-tournaments $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}$, no two of them having players in common. Their union can be regarded as a $\\left(2^{t} s, k\\right)$-tournament $T$ where each round is the union of the respective rounds in $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}$.\n\nIn summary, the condition that $2^{t_{k}}$ divides $n$ is sufficient for an $(n, k)$-tournament to exist. We prove that it is also necessary.\n\nConsider an arbitrary $(n, k)$-tournament. Represent each player by a point and after each round, join by an edge every two players who played in this round. Thus to a round $i=1, \\ldots, k$ there corresponds a graph $G_{i}$. We say that player $Q$ is an $i$-neighbour of player $P$ if there is a path of edges in $G_{i}$ from $P$ to $Q$; in other words, if there are players $P=X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{m}=Q$ such that player $X_{j}$ meets player $X_{j+1}$ in one of the first $i$ rounds, $j=1,2 \\ldots, m-1$. The set of $i$-neighbours of a player will be called its $i$-component. Clearly two $i$-components are either disjoint or coincide.\n\nHence after each round $i$ the set of players is partitioned into pairwise disjoint $i$-components. So, to achieve our goal, it suffices to show that all $k$-components have size divisible by $2^{t_{k}}$.\n\nTo this end, let us see how the $i$-component $\\Gamma$ of a player $A$ changes after round $i+1$. Suppose that $A$ meets player $B$ with $i$-component $\\Delta$ in round $i+1$ (components $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ are\n\n\n\nnot necessarily distinct). We claim that then in round $i+1$ each player from $\\Gamma$ meets a player from $\\Delta$, and vice versa.\n\nIndeed, let $C$ be any player in $\\Gamma$, and let $C$ meet $D$ in round $i+1$. Since $C$ is an $i$-neighbour of $A$, there is a sequence of players $A=X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{m}=C$ such that $X_{j}$ meets $X_{j+1}$ in one of the first $i$ rounds, $j=1,2 \\ldots, m-1$. Let $X_{j}$ meet $Y_{j}$ in round $i+1$, for $j=1,2 \\ldots, m$; in particular $Y_{1}=B$ and $Y_{m}=D$. Players $Y_{j}$ exists in view of condition (i). Suppose that $X_{j}$ and $X_{j+1}$ met in round $r$, where $r \\leq i$. Then condition (ii) implies that and $Y_{j}$ and $Y_{j+1}$ met in round $r$, too. Hence $B=Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \\ldots, Y_{m}=D$ is a path in $G_{i}$ from $B$ to $D$. This is to say, $D$ is in the $i$-component $\\Delta$ of $B$, as claimed. By symmetry, each player from $\\Delta$ meets a player from $\\Gamma$ in round $i+1$. It follows in particular that $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ have the same cardinality.\n\nIt is straightforward now that the $(i+1)$-component of $A$ is $\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta$, the union of two sets with the same size. Since $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ are either disjoint or coincide, we have either $|\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta|=2|\\Gamma|$ or $|\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta|=|\\Gamma|$; as usual, $|\\cdots|$ denotes the cardinality of a finite set.\n\nLet $\\Gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\Gamma_{k}$ be the consecutive components of a given player $A$. We obtained that either $\\left|\\Gamma_{i+1}\\right|=2\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|$ or $\\left|\\Gamma_{i+1}\\right|=\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|$ for $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. Because $\\left|\\Gamma_{1}\\right|=2$, each $\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|$ is a power of 2 , $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. In particular $\\left|\\Gamma_{k}\\right|=2^{u}$ for some $u$.\n\nOn the other hand, player $A$ has played with $k$ different opponents by (i). All of them belong to $\\Gamma_{k}$, therefore $\\left|\\Gamma_{k}\\right| \\geq k+1$.\n\nThus $2^{u} \\geq k+1$, and since $t_{k}$ is the least integer satisfying $2^{t_{k}} \\geq k+1$, we conclude that $u \\geq t_{k}$. So the size of each $k$-component is divisible by $2^{t_{k}}$, which completes the argument."

Prove that a holey triangle $T$ can be tiled with diamonds if and only if the following condition holds: Every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$ contains at most $k$ holes, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.",
        "solution": [
            "Let $T$ be a holey triangle. The unit triangles in it will be called cells. We say simply \"triangle\" instead of \"upward equilateral triangle\" and \"size\" instead of \"side length.\"\n\nThe necessity will be proven first. Assume that a holey triangle $T$ can be tiled with diamonds and consider such a tiling. Let $T^{\\prime}$ be a triangle of size $k$ in $T$ containing $h$ holes. Focus on the diamonds which cover (one or two) cells in $T^{\\prime}$. Let them form a figure $R$. The boundary of $T^{\\prime}$ consists of upward cells, so $R$ is a triangle of size $k$ with $h$ upward holes cut out and possibly some downward cells sticking out. Hence there are exactly $\\left(k^{2}+k\\right) / 2-h$ upward cells in $R$, and at least $\\left(k^{2}-k\\right) / 2$ downward cells (not counting those sticking out). On the other hand each diamond covers one upward and one downward cell, which implies $\\left(k^{2}+k\\right) / 2-h \\geq\\left(k^{2}-k\\right) / 2$. It follows that $h \\leq k$, as needed.\n\nWe pass on to the sufficiency. For brevity, let us say that a set of holes in a given triangle $T$ is spread out if every triangle of size $k$ in $T$ contains at most $k$ holes. For any set $S$ of spread out holes, a triangle of size $k$ will be called full of $S$ if it contains exactly $k$ holes of $S$. The proof is based on the following observation.\n\nLemma. Let $S$ be a set of spread out holes in $T$. Suppose that two triangles $T^{\\prime}$ and $T^{\\prime \\prime}$ are full of $S$, and that they touch or intersect. Let $T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}$ denote the smallest triangle in $T$ containing them. Then $T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}$ is also full of $S$.\n\nProof. Let triangles $T^{\\prime}, T^{\\prime \\prime}, T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}$ have sizes $a, b, c$ and $d$, and let them contain $a, b, x$ and $y$ holes of $S$, respectively. (Note that $T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}$ could be a point, in which case $c=0$.) Since $S$ is spread out, we have $x \\leq c$ and $y \\leq d$. The geometric configuration of triangles clearly satisfies $a+b=c+d$. Furthermore, $a+b \\leq x+y$, since $a+b$ counts twice the holes in $T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}$. These conclusions imply $x=c$ and $y=d$, as we wished to show.\n\nNow let $T_{n}$ be a holey triangle of size $n$, and let the set $H$ of its holes be spread out. We show by induction on $n$ that $T_{n}$ can be tiled with diamonds. The base $n=1$ is trivial. Suppose that $n \\geq 2$ and that the claim holds for holey triangles of size less than $n$.\n\nDenote by $B$ the bottom row of $T_{n}$ and by $T^{\\prime}$ the triangle formed by its top $n-1$ rows. There is at least one hole in $B$ as $T^{\\prime}$ contains at most $n-1$ holes. If this hole is only one, there is a unique way to tile $B$ with diamonds. Also, $T^{\\prime}$ contains exactly $n-1$ holes, making it a holey triangle of size $n-1$, and these holes are spread out. Hence it remains to apply the induction hypothesis.\n\nSo suppose that there are $m \\geq 2$ holes in $B$ and label them $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m}$ from left to right. Let $\\ell$ be the line separating $B$ from $T^{\\prime}$. For each $i=1, \\ldots, m-1$, pick an upward cell $b_{i}$ between $a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$, with base on $\\ell$. Place a diamond to cover $b_{i}$ and its lower neighbour, a downward cell in $B$. The remaining part of $B$ can be tiled uniquely with diamonds. Remove from $T_{n}$ row $B$ and the cells $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ to obtain a holey triangle $T_{n-1}$ of size $n-1$. The conclusion will follow by induction if the choice of $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ guarantees that the following condition is satisfied: If the holes $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m-1}$ are replaced by $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ then the new set of holes is spread out again.\n\nWe show that such a choice is possible. The cells $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ can be defined one at a time in this order, making sure that the above condition holds at each step. Thus it suffices to prove that there is an appropriate choice for $b_{1}$, and we set $a_{1}=u, a_{2}=v$ for clarity.\n\n\n\nLet $\\Delta$ be the triangle of maximum size which is full of $H$, contains the top vertex of the hole $u$, and has base on line $\\ell$. Call $\\Delta$ the associate of $u$. Observe that $\\Delta$ does not touch $v$. Indeed, if $\\Delta$ has size $r$ then it contains $r$ holes of $T_{n}$. Extending its slanted sides downwards produces a triangle $\\Delta^{\\prime}$ of size $r+1$ containing at least one more hole, namely $u$. Since there are at most $r+1$ holes in $\\Delta^{\\prime}$, it cannot contain $v$. Consequently, $\\Delta$ does not contain the top vertex of $v$.\n\nLet $w$ be the upward cell with base on $\\ell$ which is to the right of $\\Delta$ and shares a common vertex with it. The observation above shows that $w$ is to the left of $v$. Note that $w$ is not a hole, or else $\\Delta$ could be extended to a larger triangle full of $H$.\n\nWe prove that if the hole $u$ is replaced by $w$ then the new set of holes is spread out again. To verify this, we only need to check that if a triangle $\\Gamma$ in $T_{n}$ contains $w$ but not $u$ then $\\Gamma$ is not full of $H$. Suppose to the contrary that $\\Gamma$ is full of $H$. Consider the minimum triangle $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ containing $\\Gamma$ and the associate $\\Delta$ of $u$. Clearly $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ is larger than $\\Delta$, because $\\Gamma$ contains $w$ but $\\Delta$ does not. Next, $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ is full of $H \\backslash\\{u\\}$ by the lemma, since $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ have a common point and neither of them contains $u$.\n\n<img_3190>\n\nIf $\\Gamma$ is above line $\\ell$ then so is $\\Gamma+\\Delta$, which contradicts the maximum choice of $\\Delta$. If $\\Gamma$ contains cells from row $B$, observe that $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ contains $u$. Let $s$ be the size of $\\Gamma+\\Delta$. Being full of $H \\backslash\\{u\\}, \\Gamma+\\Delta$ contains $s$ holes other than $u$. But it also contains $u$, contradicting the assumption that $H$ is spread out.\n\nThe claim follows, showing that $b_{1}=w$ is an appropriate choice for $a_{1}=u$ and $a_{2}=v$. As explained above, this is enough to complete the induction."

These decompositions are closely related to the problem.\n\n\n\nLemma 1.

First note that by properties (a,b,c) above, the two regions cannot share only a single point or an arc. They are either disjoint or they overlap.\n\nAssume that the two regions have a common interior point $u$. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two parallel support planes of $\\Gamma$ through points $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$, respectively, with normal vector $u$. By the definition of regions $S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right), u$ is the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$ and the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$. Therefore polyhedron $\\Gamma$ lies between the two planes; vertices $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal.\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, assume that $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal. Then there exist two parallel support planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ through $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$, respectively, such that $\\Gamma$ is between them. Let $u$ be the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$; then $u$ is the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$, therefore $u \\in S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right) \\cap S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$. The two regions have a common point, so they overlap.\n\nProof of lemma 2. Again, by properties (a,b) above, the endpoints of arc $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ cannot belong to $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ and vice versa. The two arcs are either disjoint or intersecting.\n\nAssume that arcs $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ intersect at point $u$. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be the two support planes through edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$, respectively, with normal vector $u$. By the definition of $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$, vector $u$ points inwards from $P_{1}$ and outwards from $P_{2}$. Therefore $\\Gamma$ is between the planes. Since planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ pass through $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$, these points are antipodal.\n\nFor the opposite direction, assume that points $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ are antipodal. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two support planes through these points, respectively. An edge cannot intersect a support plane, therefore $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ lie in the planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, respectively. Let $u$ be the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$, which is also the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$. Then $u \\in S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right) \\cap S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$. So the two arcs are not disjoint; they therefore intersect.\n\nNow create a new decomposition of sphere $S$. Draw all $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{-}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ on sphere $S$ and put a knot at each point where two arcs meet. We have $\\ell$ knots at points $S^{+}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$ and another $\\ell$ knots at points $S^{-}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$, corresponding to the faces of $\\Gamma$; by property (c) they are different. We also have some pairs $1 \\leq i, j \\leq m$ where $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ intersect. By Lemma 2, each antipodal pair $\\left(Q_{i}, Q_{j}\\right)$ gives rise to two such intersections; hence, the number of all intersections is $2 B$ and we have $2 \\ell+2 B$ knots in all.\n\nEach intersection knot splits two arcs, increasing the number of arcs by 2 . Since we started with $2 m$ arcs, corresponding the edges of $\\Gamma$, the number of the resulting curve segments is $2 m+4 B$.\n\nThe network of these curve segments divides the sphere into some \"new\" regions. Each new region is the intersection of some overlapping sets $S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$. Due to the convexity, the intersection of two overlapping regions is convex and thus contiguous. By Lemma 1, each pair of overlapping regions corresponds to an antipodal vertex pair and each antipodal vertex pair gives rise to two different overlaps, which are symmetric with respect to the origin. So the number of new regions is $2 A$.\n\nThe result now follows from Euler's polyhedron theorem. We have $n+l=m+2$ and\n\n$$\n(2 \\ell+2 B)+2 A=(2 m+4 B)+2,\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\nA-B=m-\\ell+1=n-1 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTherefore $A-B$ is by one less than the number of vertices of $\\Gamma$.",
            "Use the same notations for the polyhedron and its vertices, edges and faces as in Solution 1. We regard points as vectors starting from the origin. Polyhedron $\\Gamma$ is regarded as a closed convex set, including its interior. In some cases the edges and faces of $\\Gamma$ are also regarded as sets of points. The symbol $\\partial$ denotes the boundary of the certain set; e.g. $\\partial \\Gamma$ is the surface of $\\Gamma$.\n\nLet $\\Delta=\\Gamma-\\Gamma=\\{U-V: U, V \\in \\Gamma\\}$ be the set of vectors between arbitrary points of $\\Gamma$. Then $\\Delta$, being the sum of two bounded convex sets, is also a bounded convex set and, by construction, it is also centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. We will prove that $\\Delta$ is also a polyhedron and express the numbers of its faces, edges and vertices in terms $n, m, \\ell, A$ and $B$.\n\nLemma 1. For points $U, V \\in \\Gamma$, point $W=U-V$ is a boundary point of $\\Delta$ if and only if $U$ and $V$ are antipodal. Moreover, for each boundary point $W \\in \\partial \\Delta$ there exists exactly one pair of points $U, V \\in \\Gamma$ such that $W=U-V$.\n\nProof. Assume first that $U$ and $V$ are antipodal points of $\\Gamma$. Let parallel support planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ pass through them such that $\\Gamma$ is in between. Consider plane $P=P_{1}-U=$ $P_{2}-V$. This plane separates the interiors of $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$. After reflecting one of the sets, e.g. $\\Gamma-V$, the sets $\\Gamma-U$ and $-\\Gamma+V$ lie in the same half space bounded by $P$. Then $(\\Gamma-U)+(-\\Gamma+V)=\\Delta-W$ lies in that half space, so $0 \\in P$ is a boundary point of the set $\\Delta-W$. Translating by $W$ we obtain that $W$ is a boundary point of $\\Delta$.\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, let $W=U-V$ be a boundary point of $\\Delta$, and let $\\Psi=$ $(\\Gamma-U) \\cap(\\Gamma-V)$. We claim that $\\Psi=\\{0\\}$. Clearly $\\Psi$ is a bounded convex set and $0 \\in \\Psi$. For any two points $X, Y \\in \\Psi$, we have $U+X, V+Y \\in \\Gamma$ and $W+(X-Y)=(U+X)-(V+Y) \\in \\Delta$. Since $W$ is a boundary point of $\\Delta$, the vector $X-Y$ cannot have the same direction as $W$. This implies that the interior of $\\Psi$ is empty. Now suppose that $\\Psi$ contains a line segment $S$. Then $S+U$ and $S+V$ are subsets of some faces or edges of $\\Gamma$ and these faces/edges are parallel to $S$. In all cases, we find two faces, two edges, or a face and an edge which are parallel, contradicting the conditions of the problem. Therefore, $\\Psi=\\{0\\}$ indeed.\n\nSince $\\Psi=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap(\\Gamma-V)$ consists of a single point, the interiors of bodies $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$ are disjoint and there exists a plane $P$ which separates them. Let $u$ be the normal vector of $P$ pointing into that half space bounded by $P$ which contains $\\Gamma-U$. Consider the planes $P+U$ and $P+V$; they are support planes of $\\Gamma$, passing through $U$ and $V$, respectively. From plane $P+U$, the vector $u$ points into that half space which contains $\\Gamma$. From plane $P+V$, vector $u$ points into the opposite half space containing $\\Gamma$. Therefore, we found two proper support through points $U$ and $V$ such that $\\Gamma$ is in between.\n\nFor the uniqueness part, assume that there exist points $U_{1}, V_{1} \\in \\Gamma$ such that $U_{1}-V_{1}=U-V$. The points $U_{1}-U$ and $V_{1}-V$ lie in the sets $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$ separated by $P$. Since $U_{1}-U=V_{1}-V$, this can happen only if both are in $P$; but the only such point is 0 . Therefore, $U_{1}-V_{1}=U-V$ implies $U_{1}=U$ and $V_{1}=V$. The lemma is complete.\n\nLemma 2. Let $U$ and $V$ be two antipodal points and assume that plane $P$, passing through 0 , separates the interiors of $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$. Let $\\Psi_{1}=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap P$ and $\\Psi_{2}=(\\Gamma-V) \\cap P$. Then $\\Delta \\cap(P+U-V)=\\Psi_{1}-\\Psi_{2}+U-V$.\n\nProof. The sets $\\Gamma-U$ and $-\\Gamma+V$ lie in the same closed half space bounded by $P$. Therefore, for any points $X \\in(\\Gamma-U)$ and $Y \\in(-\\Gamma+V)$, we have $X+Y \\in P$ if and only if $X, Y \\in P$. Then\n\n$(\\Delta-(U-V)) \\cap P=((\\Gamma-U)+(-\\Gamma+V)) \\cap P=((\\Gamma-U) \\cap P)+((-\\Gamma+V) \\cap P)=\\Psi_{1}-\\Psi_{2}$.\n\nNow a translation by $(U-V)$ completes the lemma.\n\n\n\nNow classify the boundary points $W=U-V$ of $\\Delta$, according to the types of points $U$ and $V$. In all cases we choose a plane $P$ through 0 which separates the interiors of $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$. We will use the notation $\\Psi_{1}=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap P$ and $\\Psi_{2}=(\\Gamma-V) \\cap P$ as well.\n\nCase 1: Both $U$ and $V$ are vertices of $\\Gamma$. Bodies $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$ have a common vertex which is 0 . Choose plane $P$ in such a way that $\\Psi_{1}=\\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}$. Then Lemma 2 yields $\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=\\{W\\}$. Therefore $P+W$ is a support plane of $\\Delta$ such that they have only one common point so no line segment exists on $\\partial \\Delta$ which would contain $W$ in its interior.\n\nSince this case occurs for antipodal vertex pairs and each pair is counted twice, the number of such boundary points on $\\Delta$ is $2 A$.\n\nCase 2: Point $U$ is an interior point of an edge $E_{i}$ and $V$ is a vertex of $\\Gamma$. Choose plane $P$ such that $\\Psi_{1}=E_{i}-U$ and $\\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}$. By Lemma $2, \\Delta \\cap(P+W)=E_{i}-V$. Hence there exists a line segment in $\\partial \\Delta$ which contains $W$ in its interior, but there is no planar region in $\\partial \\Delta$ with the same property.\n\nWe obtain a similar result if $V$ belongs to an edge of $\\Gamma$ and $U$ is a vertex.\n\nCase 3: Points $U$ and $V$ are interior points of edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$, respectively. Let $P$ be the plane of $E_{i}-U$ and $E_{j}-V$. Then $\\Psi_{1}=E_{i}-U, \\Psi_{2}=E_{j}-V$ and $\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=E_{i}-E_{j}$. Therefore point $W$ belongs to a parallelogram face on $\\partial \\Delta$.\n\nThe centre of the parallelogram is $Q_{i}-Q_{j}$, the vector between the midpoints. Therefore an edge pair $\\left(E_{i}, E_{j}\\right)$ occurs if and only if $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ are antipodal which happens $2 B$ times.\n\nCase 4: Point $U$ lies in the interior of a face $F_{i}$ and $V$ is a vertex of $\\Gamma$. The only choice for $P$ is the plane of $F_{i}-U$. Then we have $\\Psi_{1}=F_{i}-U, \\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}$ and $\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=F_{i}-V$. This is a planar face of $\\partial \\Delta$ which is congruent to $F_{i}$.\n\nFor each face $F_{i}$, the only possible vertex $V$ is the farthest one from the plane of $F_{i}$.\n\nIf $U$ is a vertex and $V$ belongs to face $F_{i}$ then we obtain the same way that $W$ belongs to a face $-F_{i}+U$ which is also congruent to $F_{i}$. Therefore, each face of $\\Gamma$ has two copies on $\\partial \\Delta$, a translated and a reflected copy.\n\nCase 5: Point $U$ belongs to a face $F_{i}$ of $\\Gamma$ and point $V$ belongs to an edge or a face $G$. In this case objects $F_{i}$ and $G$ must be parallel which is not allowed.\n<img_3967>\n\nNow all points in $\\partial \\Delta$ belong to some planar polygons (cases 3 and 4 ), finitely many line segments (case 2) and points (case 1). Therefore $\\Delta$ is indeed a polyhedron. Now compute the numbers of its vertices, edges and faces.\n\nThe vertices are obtained in case 1 , their number is $2 A$.\n\nFaces are obtained in cases 3 and 4 . Case 3 generates $2 B$ parallelogram faces. Case 4 generates $2 \\ell$ faces.\n\nWe compute the number of edges of $\\Delta$ from the degrees (number of sides) of faces of $\\Gamma$. Let $d_{i}$ be the the degree of face $F_{i}$. The sum of degrees is twice as much as the number of edges, so $d_{1}+d_{2}+\\ldots+d_{l}=2 m$. The sum of degrees of faces of $\\Delta$ is $2 B \\cdot 4+2\\left(d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdots+d_{l}\\right)=8 B+4 m$, so the number of edges on $\\Delta$ is $4 B+2 m$.\n\nApplying Euler's polyhedron theorem on $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$, we have $n+l=m+2$ and $2 A+(2 B+2 \\ell)=$ $(4 B+2 m)+2$. Then the conclusion follows:\n\n$$\nA-B=m-\\ell+1=n-1 \\text {. }\n$$"

We proceed as in the first solution to define a triangle $A B C$ with orthocentre $D$, in which $A F$ and $B E$ are altitudes.\n\nDenote by $M$ the midpoint of $C D$. The quadrilateral $C E D F$ is inscribed in a circle with centre $M$, hence $M C=M E=M D=M F$.\n\n<img_3328>\n\nConsider triangles $A B C$ and $O_{1} O_{2} M$. Lines $O_{1} O_{2}$ and $A B$ are parallel, both of them being perpendicular to line $t$. Next, $M O_{1}$ is the line of centres of circles $(C E F)$ and $\\omega_{1}$ whose common chord is $D E$. Hence $M O_{1}$ bisects $\\angle D M E$ which is the external angle at $M$ in the isosceles triangle $C E M$. It follows that $\\angle D M O_{1}=\\angle D C A$, so that $M O_{1}$ is parallel to $A C$. Likewise, $M O_{2}$ is parallel to $B C$.\n\nThus the respective sides of triangles $A B C$ and $O_{1} O_{2} M$ are parallel; in addition, these triangles are not congruent. Hence there is a homothety taking $A B C$ to $O_{1} O_{2} M$. The lines $A O_{1}$, $B O_{2}$ and $C M=t$ are concurrent at the centre $Q$ of this homothety.\n\nFinally, apply Pappus' theorem to the triples of collinear points $A, O, B$ and $O_{2}, D, O_{1}$. The theorem implies that the points $A D \\cap O O_{2}=F, A O_{1} \\cap B O_{2}=Q$ and $O O_{1} \\cap B D=E$ are collinear. In other words, line $E F$ passes through the common point $Q$ of $A O_{1}, B O_{2}$ and $t$.\n\nComment. Relation (1) from Solution 1 expresses the well-known fact that points $P$ and $K$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to points $C$ and $D$. It is also easy to justify it by direct computation. Denoting $\\angle C A B=\\alpha, \\angle A B C=\\beta$, it is straightforward to obtain $C P / P D=C K / K D=\\tan \\alpha \\tan \\beta$."

The homothety with centre $T_{b}$ and ratio $T_{b} T_{a} / T_{b} U$ maps the circle $\\omega_{b}$ onto the circumcircle of $A B C$ and the line $U X$ onto the line tangent to the circumcircle at $T_{a}$, which is parallel to $B C$; thus $U X \\| B C$. The same is true of $V Y$, so that $U X\\|B C\\| V Y$.\n\nLet $T_{a} T_{b}$ cut $A C$ at $P$ and let $T_{a} T_{c}$ cut $A B$ at $Q$. The point $X$ lies on the hypotenuse $P M_{b}$ of the right triangle $P U M_{b}$ and is equidistant from $U$ and $M_{b}$. So $X$ is the midpoint of $M_{b} P$. Similarly $Y$ is the midpoint of $M_{c} Q$.\n\nDenote the incentre of triangle $A B C$ as usual by $I$. It is a known fact that $T_{a} I=T_{a} B$ and $T_{c} I=T_{c} B$.

Analogous conclusions hold for the lines $p_{b}$ and $p_{c}$. So these three lines form a triangle homothetic from centre $I$ to triangle $M_{a} M_{b} M_{c}$ in ratio $1 / 2$, hence similar to $A B C$ in ratio $1 / 4$."

Thus $\\angle A D T+\\angle B C T=\\angle A T Z+\\angle B T Z=\\angle A T B$.\n\nAnd conversely, if $\\angle A D T+\\angle B C T=\\angle A T B$ then one can draw from $T$ a ray $T Z$ with $Z$ on $A B$ so that $\\angle A D T=\\angle A T Z, \\angle B C T=\\angle B T Z$. The first of these equalities implies that $T Z$ is tangent to the circle $(D A T)$; by the second equality, $T Z$ is tangent to the circle $(B C T)$, so the two circles are tangent at $T$.\n\n<img_3708>\n\nSo the equivalence (1) is settled. It will be used later on. Now pass to the actual solution. Its key idea is to introduce the circumcircles of triangles $A B P$ and $C D P$ and to consider their second intersection $Q$ (assume for the moment that they indeed meet at two distinct points $P$ and $Q$ ).\n\nSince the point $A$ lies outside the circle $(B C P)$, we have $\\angle B C P+\\angle B A P<180^{\\circ}$. Therefore the point $C$ lies outside the circle $(A B P)$. Analogously, $D$ also lies outside that circle. It follows that $P$ and $Q$ lie on the same $\\operatorname{arc} C D$ of the circle $(B C P)$.\n\n<img_3746>\n\n\n\nBy symmetry, $P$ and $Q$ lie on the same arc $A B$ of the circle $(A B P)$. Thus the point $Q$ lies either inside the angle $B P C$ or inside the angle $A P D$. Without loss of generality assume that $Q$ lies inside the angle $B P C$. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle A Q D=\\angle P Q A+\\angle P Q D=\\angle P B A+\\angle P C D \\leq 90^{\\circ}\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nby the condition of the problem.\n\nIn the cyclic quadrilaterals $A P Q B$ and $D P Q C$, the angles at vertices $A$ and $D$ are acute. So their angles at $Q$ are obtuse. This implies that $Q$ lies not only inside the angle $B P C$ but in fact inside the triangle $B P C$, hence also inside the quadrilateral $A B C D$.\n\nNow an argument similar to that used in deriving (2) shows that\n\n$$\n\\angle B Q C=\\angle P A B+\\angle P D C \\leq 90^{\\circ} .\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $\\angle P C Q=\\angle P D Q$, we get\n\n$$\n\\angle A D Q+\\angle B C Q=\\angle A D P+\\angle P D Q+\\angle B C P-\\angle P C Q=\\angle A D P+\\angle B C P .\n$$\n\nThe last sum is equal to $\\angle A P B$, according to the observation (1) applied to $T=P$. And because $\\angle A P B=\\angle A Q B$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\angle A D Q+\\angle B C Q=\\angle A Q B\n$$\n\nApplying now (1) to $T=Q$ we conclude that the circles $(B C Q)$ and $(D A Q)$ are externally tangent at $Q$. (We have assumed $P \\neq Q$; but if $P=Q$ then the last conclusion holds trivially.)\n\nFinally consider the halfdiscs with diameters $B C$ and $D A$ constructed inwardly to the quadrilateral $A B C D$. They have centres at $M$ and $N$, the midpoints of $B C$ and $D A$ respectively. In view of (2) and (3), these two halfdiscs lie entirely inside the circles $(B Q C)$ and $(A Q D)$; and since these circles are tangent, the two halfdiscs cannot overlap. Hence $M N \\geq \\frac{1}{2} B C+\\frac{1}{2} D A$.\n\nOn the other hand, since $\\overrightarrow{M N}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{B A}+\\overrightarrow{C D})$, we have $M N \\leq \\frac{1}{2}(A B+C D)$.

By main diagonals of the (2n)-gon we shall mean those which partition the (2n)-gon into two polygons with equally many sides. For any side $b$ of the $(2 n)$-gon denote by $\\Delta_{b}$ the triangle $A B P$ where $A, B$ are the endpoints of $b$ and $P$ is the intersection point of the main diagonals $A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}$. We claim that the union of triangles $\\Delta_{b}$, taken over all sides, covers the whole polygon.\n\nTo show this, choose any side $A B$ and consider the main diagonal $A A^{\\prime}$ as a directed segment. Let $X$ be any point in the polygon, not on any main diagonal. For definiteness, let $X$ lie on the left side of the ray $A A^{\\prime}$. Consider the sequence of main diagonals $A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}, C C^{\\prime}, \\ldots$, where $A, B, C, \\ldots$ are consecutive vertices, situated right to $A A^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe $n$-th item in this sequence is the diagonal $A^{\\prime} A$ (i.e. $A A^{\\prime}$ reversed), having $X$ on its right side. So there are two successive vertices $K, L$ in the sequence $A, B, C, \\ldots$ before $A^{\\prime}$ such that $X$ still lies to the left of $K K^{\\prime}$ but to the right of $L L^{\\prime}$. And this means that $X$ is in the triangle $\\Delta_{\\ell^{\\prime}}, \\ell^{\\prime}=K^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}$. Analogous reasoning applies to points $X$ on the right of $A A^{\\prime}$ (points lying on main diagonals can be safely ignored). Thus indeed the triangles $\\Delta_{b}$ jointly cover the whole polygon.\n\nThe sum of their areas is no less than $S$.

One can assume that in such cases the respective opposite vectors occur in the order $-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}},-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots,-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+r}}$, ensuring that $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+n}}=-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, 2 n$. Indices are taken cyclically here and in similar situations below.\n\nChoose points $B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{2 n}$ satisfying $\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, 2 n$. The polygonal line $\\mathcal{Q}=B_{1} B_{2} \\ldots B_{2 n}$ is closed, since $\\sum_{j=1}^{2 n} \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}=\\overrightarrow{0}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{Q}$ is a convex $(2 n)$-gon due to the arrangement of the vectors $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$, possibly with $180^{\\circ}$-angles. The side vectors of $\\mathcal{Q}$ are $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$, $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. So in particular $\\mathcal{Q}$ is centrally symmetric, because it contains as side vectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ and $-\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ for each $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Note that $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ are opposite sides of $\\mathcal{Q}$, $1 \\leq j \\leq n$. We call $\\mathcal{Q}$ the associate of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nLet $S_{i}$ be the maximum area of a triangle with side $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ in $\\mathcal{P}, 1 \\leq i \\leq n$. We prove that\n\n$$\n\\left[B_{1} B_{2} \\ldots B_{2 n}\\right]=2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} S_{i} \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left[B_{1} B_{2} \\ldots B_{2 n}\\right] \\geq 4\\left[A_{1} A_{2} \\ldots A_{n}\\right] \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIt is clear that (1) and (2) imply the conclusion of the original problem.\n\nLemma. For a side $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$, let $h_{i}$ be the maximum distance from a point of $\\mathcal{P}$ to line $A_{i} A_{i+1}$, $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Denote by $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ the side of $\\mathcal{Q}$ such that $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}=\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}$. Then the distance between $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and its opposite side in $\\mathcal{Q}$ is equal to $2 h_{i}$.\n\nProof. Choose a vertex $A_{k}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$ at distance $h_{i}$ from line $A_{i} A_{i+1}$. Let $\\mathbf{u}$ be the unit vector perpendicular to $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and pointing inside $\\mathcal{P}$. Denoting by $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}$ the dot product of vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, we have\n\n$$\nh=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{k}}=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{A_{k-1} A_{k}}\\right)=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i-1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{A_{k+1} A_{k}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn $\\mathcal{Q}$, the distance $H_{i}$ between the opposite sides $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ is given by\n\n$$\nH_{i}=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{B_{j+n-1} B_{j+n}}\\right)=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}+\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+n-1}}\\right) .\n$$\n\nThe choice of vertex $A_{k}$ implies that the $n$ consecutive vectors $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+n-1}}$ are precisely $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{A_{k-1} A_{k}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i-1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{A_{k+1} A_{k}}$, taken in some order. This implies $H_{i}=2 h_{i}$.\n\nFor a proof of (1), apply the lemma to each side of $\\mathcal{P}$. If $O$ the centre of $\\mathcal{Q}$ then, using the notation of the lemma,\n\n$$\n\\left[B_{j} B_{j+1} O\\right]=\\left[B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1} O\\right]=\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} A_{k}\\right]=S_{i}\n$$\n\nSummation over all sides of $\\mathcal{P}$ yields (1).\n\nSet $d(\\mathcal{P})=[\\mathcal{Q}]-4[\\mathcal{P}]$ for a convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ with associate $\\mathcal{Q}$. Inequality $(2)$ means that $d(\\mathcal{P}) \\geq 0$ for each convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$. The last inequality will be proved by induction on the\n\n\n\nnumber $\\ell$ of side directions of $\\mathcal{P}$, i. e. the number of pairwise nonparallel lines each containing a side of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nWe choose to start the induction with $\\ell=1$ as a base case, meaning that certain degenerate polygons are allowed. More exactly, we regard as degenerate convex polygons all closed polygonal lines of the form $X_{1} X_{2} \\ldots X_{k} Y_{1} Y_{2} \\ldots Y_{m} X_{1}$, where $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{k}$ are points in this order on a line segment $X_{1} Y_{1}$, and so are $Y_{m}, Y_{m-1}, \\ldots, Y_{1}$. The initial construction applies to degenerate polygons; their associates are also degenerate, and the value of $d$ is zero. For the inductive step, consider a convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ which determines $\\ell$ side directions, assuming that $d(\\mathcal{P}) \\geq 0$ for polygons with smaller values of $\\ell$.\n\nSuppose first that $\\mathcal{P}$ has a pair of parallel sides, i. e. sides on distinct parallel lines. Let $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{j} A_{j+1}$ be such a pair, and let $A_{i} A_{i+1} \\leq A_{j} A_{j+1}$. Remove from $\\mathcal{P}$ the parallelogram $R$ determined by vectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j+1}}$. Two polygons are obtained in this way. Translating one of them by vector $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ yields a new convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$, of area $[\\mathcal{P}]-[R]$ and with value of $\\ell$ not exceeding the one of $\\mathcal{P}$. The construction just described will be called operation A.\n<img_3326>\n\nThe associate of $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is obtained from $\\mathcal{Q}$ upon decreasing the lengths of two opposite sides by an amount of $2 A_{i} A_{i+1}$. By the lemma, the distance between these opposite sides is twice the distance between $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{j} A_{j+1}$. Thus operation $\\mathbf{A}$ decreases $[\\mathcal{Q}]$ by the area of a parallelogram with base and respective altitude twice the ones of $R$, i. e. by $4[R]$. Hence $\\mathbf{A}$ leaves the difference $d(\\mathcal{P})=[\\mathcal{Q}]-4[\\mathcal{P}]$ unchanged.\n\nNow, if $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ also has a pair of parallel sides, apply operation $\\mathbf{A}$ to it. Keep doing so with the subsequent polygons obtained for as long as possible. Now, A decreases the number $p$ of pairs of parallel sides in $\\mathcal{P}$. Hence its repeated applications gradually reduce $p$ to 0 , and further applications of $\\mathbf{A}$ will be impossible after several steps. For clarity, let us denote by $\\mathcal{P}$ again the polygon obtained at that stage.\n\nThe inductive step is complete if $\\mathcal{P}$ is degenerate. Otherwise $\\ell>1$ and $p=0$, i. e. there are no parallel sides in $\\mathcal{P}$. Observe that then $\\ell \\geq 3$. Indeed, $\\ell=2$ means that the vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$ all lie on the boundary of a parallelogram, implying $p>0$.\n\nFurthermore, since $\\mathcal{P}$ has no parallel sides, consecutive collinear vectors in the sequence $\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{k}}\\right)$ (if any) correspond to consecutive $180^{\\circ}$-angles in $\\mathcal{P}$. Removing the vertices of such angles, we obtain a convex polygon with the same value of $d(\\mathcal{P})$.\n\nIn summary, if operation $\\mathbf{A}$ is impossible for a nondegenerate polygon $\\mathcal{P}$, then $\\ell \\geq 3$. In addition, one may assume that $\\mathcal{P}$ has no angles of size $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe last two conditions then also hold for the associate $\\mathcal{Q}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$, and we perform the following construction. Since $\\ell \\geq 3$, there is a side $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ of $\\mathcal{Q}$ such that the sum of the angles at $B_{j}$ and $B_{j+1}$ is greater than $180^{\\circ}$. (Such a side exists in each convex $k$-gon for $k>4$.) Naturally, $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ is a side with the same property. Extend the pairs of sides $B_{j-1} B_{j}, B_{j+1} B_{j+2}$\n\n\n\nand $B_{j+n-1} B_{j+n}, B_{j+n+1} B_{j+n+2}$ to meet at $U$ and $V$, respectively. Let $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$ be the centrally symmetric convex 2(n+1)-gon obtained from $\\mathcal{Q}$ by inserting $U$ and $V$ into the sequence $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{2 n}$ as new vertices between $B_{j}, B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n}, B_{j+n+1}$, respectively. Informally, we adjoin to $\\mathcal{Q}$ the congruent triangles $B_{j} B_{j+1} U$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1} V$. Note that $B_{j}, B_{j+1}, B_{j+n}$ and $B_{j+n+1}$ are kept as vertices of $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$, although $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ are no longer its sides.\n\nLet $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ be the side of $\\mathcal{P}$ such that $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}=\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$. Consider the point $W$ such that triangle $A_{i} A_{i+1} W$ is congruent to triangle $B_{j} B_{j+1} U$ and exterior to $\\mathcal{P}$. Insert $W$ into the sequence $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ as a new vertex between $A_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}$ to obtain an $(n+1)$-gon $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. We claim that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is convex and its associate is $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$.\n<img_3469>\n\nVectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} W}$ and $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}$ are collinear and have the same direction, as well as vectors $\\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}$. Since $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}$ are consecutive terms in the sequence $\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{k}}\\right)$, the angle inequalities $\\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}\\right) \\leq \\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{A_{i-1} A_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}\\right)$ and $\\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}\\right) \\leq \\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{A_{i+1} A_{i+2}}\\right)$ hold true. They show that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is a convex polygon. To construct its associate, vectors $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}= \\pm \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$ must be deleted from the defining sequence $\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{k}}\\right)$ of $\\mathcal{Q}$, and the vectors $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} W}, \\pm \\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}}$ must be inserted appropriately into it. The latter can be done as follows:\n\n$$\n\\ldots, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}, \\overrightarrow{A_{i} W}, \\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots,-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}},-\\overrightarrow{A_{i} W},-\\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}},-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis updated sequence produces $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$ as the associate of $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$.\n\nIt follows from the construction that $\\left[\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\right]=[\\mathcal{P}]+\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} W\\right]$ and $\\left[\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}\\right]=[\\mathcal{Q}]+2\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} W\\right]$. Therefore $d\\left(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\right)=d(\\mathcal{P})-2\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} W\\right]<d(\\mathcal{P})$.\n\nTo finish the induction, it remains to notice that the value of $\\ell$ for $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is less than the one for $\\mathcal{P}$. This is because side $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ was removed. The newly added sides $A_{i} W$ and $W A_{i+1}$ do not introduce new side directions. Each one of them is either parallel to a side of $\\mathcal{P}$ or lies on the line determined by such a side. The proof is complete."

Since $d$ is a divisor of $a$, we also have\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+m k\\right) \\equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\\left(b_{j}+n k\\right) \\quad(\\bmod d) .\n$$\n\nBecause $d$ is a divisor of $k$ and in view of $(1)$, we obtain $i \\equiv j(\\bmod d)$. As $i, j \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\}$, this just means that $i=j$. Substituting this into (3) yields $m k \\equiv n k(\\bmod a)$. Therefore $m k^{\\prime} \\equiv n k^{\\prime}\\left(\\bmod a^{\\prime}\\right)$; and since $a^{\\prime}$ and $k^{\\prime}$ are coprime, we get $m \\equiv n\\left(\\bmod a^{\\prime}\\right)$. Hence also $m=n$\n\nIt follows that the $a$ numbers that make up the $d$ sequences (2) satisfy all the requirements; they are certainly all greater than $N$ because we chose each $b_{i}>\\max \\left(2^{M}, N\\right)$.

The thimblerigger performs a sequence of 2021 moves; in the $k^{\\text {th }}$ move, he swaps the positions of the two thimbles adjacent to thimble $k$.\n\nProve that there exists a value of $k$ such that, in the $k^{\\text {th }}$ move, the thimblerigger swaps some thimbles $a$ and $b$ such that $a<k<b$.",
        "solution": [
            "Assume the contrary. Say that the $k^{\\text {th }}$ thimble is the central thimble of the $k^{\\text {th }}$ move, and its position on that move is the central position of the move.\n\nStep 1: Black and white colouring. \n\nBefore the moves start, let us paint all thimbles in white. Then, after each move, we repaint its central thimble in black. This way, at the end of the process all thimbles have become black.\n\nBy our assumption, in every move $k$, the two swapped thimbles have the same colour (as their numbers are either both larger or both smaller than $k$ ). At every moment, assign the colours of the thimbles to their current positions; then the only position which changes its colour in a move is its central position. In particular, each position is central for exactly one move (when it is being repainted to black).\n\nStep 2: Red and green colouring.\n\nNow we introduce a colouring of the positions. If in the $k^{\\text {th }}$ move, the numbers of the two swapped thimbles are both less than $k$, then we paint the central position of the move in red; otherwise we paint that position in green. This way, each position has been painted in red or green exactly once. We claim that among any two adjacent positions, one becomes green and the other one becomes red; this will provide the desired contradiction since 2021 is odd.\n\nConsider two adjacent positions $A$ and $B$, which are central in the $a^{\\text {th }}$ and in the $b^{\\text {th }}$ moves, respectively, with $a<b$. Then in the $a^{\\text {th }}$ move the thimble at position $B$ is white, and therefore has a number greater than $a$. After the $a^{\\text {th }}$ move, position $A$ is green and the thimble at position $A$ is black. By the arguments from Step 1, position $A$ contains only black thimbles after the $a^{\\text {th }}$ step. Therefore, on the $b^{\\text {th }}$ move, position $A$ contains a black thimble whose number is therefore less than $b$, while thimble $b$ is at position $B$. So position $B$ becomes red, and hence $A$ and $B$ have different colours."

The cut-edges in the cut $(S, T)$ are the edges going from $S$ to $T$, and the size $e(S, T)$ of the cut is the number of cut-edges.\n\nWe will make use of the following theorem (which is a partial case of the Ford-Fulkerson \"min-cut max-flow\" theorem).\n\nTheorem (Menger). Let $G$ be a directed graph, and let $s$ and $t$ be its distinct vertices. Then the maximal number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ is equal to the minimal size of an $(s, t)$-cut.\n\nBack to the problem. Consider a directed graph $G$ whose vertices are the cities, and edges correspond to the roads.

As the rabbit's $x$-coordinate is unbounded, it will eventually visit two black cells in distinct columns. With the help of colouring $C_{1}$ the hunter can catch that moment, and determine the difference of $x$-coordinates of those two black cells, hence deducing the precise column.\n\nSymmetrically, under the condition that the rabbit's $y$-coordinate is unbounded, there is a colouring $C_{4}$ that allows the hunter to determine the exact value of the $y$-coordinate.\n\n- Finally, under the condition that the sum $x+y$ of the rabbit's coordinates is unbounded, colouring $C_{5}$ allows to determine the exact value of this sum: The diagonal lines $x+y=$ const are coloured black and white, so that the gaps between neighboring black diagonals are pairwise distinct.\n\nUnless the rabbit gets stuck, at least two of the three values $x, y$ and $x+y$ must be unbounded as the rabbit keeps moving.

One can regard the blue cells as those reachable from $F$ by anti-hops, i.e. moves downwards and to the left. We also colour all cells in $X$ green. It follows from the definition of the blocking set that no cell will be coloured twice. In Figure 2 we show a sample of a blocking set and the corresponding colouring.\n\nNow assume that $X$ is a minimal blocking set. We denote by $R$ (resp., $B$ and $G$ ) be the total number of red (resp., blue and green) cells.\n\nWe claim that $G \\leqslant R+1$ and $G \\leqslant B+1$.

Indeed, on Figure 3(a) the cell marked with \"?\" does not block any path, while on Figure 3(b) the cell marked with \"?\" should be coloured red and blue simultaneously. So we can split all green cells into chains consisting of three types of links shown on Figure 4 (diagonal link in the other direction is not allowed, corresponding green cells must belong to different chains). For example, there are 3 chains in Figure 2(b).\n\n<img_3801>\nFigure 3\n\n\n<img_3377>\n\nand\n\n<img_3940>\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3548>\n\nand\n\n<img_3741>\n\nFigure 5\n\nWe will inscribe green chains in disjoint axis-aligned rectangles so that the number of green cells in each rectangle will not exceed $1 / 3$ of the area of the rectangle. This will give us the bound $G \\leqslant 3 m^{2}$. Sometimes the rectangle will be the minimal bounding rectangle of the chain, sometimes minimal bounding rectangles will be expanded in one or two directions in order to have sufficiently large area.\n\nNote that for any two consecutive cells in the chain the colouring of some neighbouring cells is uniquely defined (see Figure 5). In particular, this observation gives a corresponding rectangle for the chains of height (or width) 1 (see Figure 6(a)). A separate green cell can be inscribed in $1 \\times 3$ or $3 \\times 1$ rectangle with one red and one blue cell, see Figure $6(\\mathrm{~b})-(\\mathrm{c})$, otherwise we get one of impossible configurations shown in Figure 3.\n\n<img_3511>\n\n$(a)$\n\n<img_3415>\n\n(b)\n\n<img_3727>\n\n$(c)$\n\nFigure 6\n\n<img_3401>\n\n(a)\n\n<img_3913>\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7\n\nAny diagonal chain of length 2 is always inscribed in a $2 \\times 3$ or $3 \\times 2$ rectangle without another green cells. Indeed, one of the squares marked with \"?\" in Figure 7(a) must be red. If it is the bottom question mark, then the remaining cell in the corresponding $2 \\times 3$ rectangle must have the same colour, see Figure 7(b).\n\nA longer chain of height (or width) 2 always has a horizontal (resp., vertical) link and can be inscribed into a $3 \\times a$ rectangle. In this case we expand the minimal bounding rectangle across the long side which touches the mentioned link. On Figure 8(a) the corresponding expansion of the minimal bounding rectangle is coloured in light blue. The upper right corner cell must be also blue. Indeed it cannot be red or green. If it is not coloured in blue, see Figure 8(b), then all anti-hop paths from $F$ to \"?\" are blocked with green cells. And these green cells are surrounded by blue ones, what is impossible. In this case the green chain contains $a$ cells, which is exactly $1 / 3$ of the area of the rectangle.\n\n\n\n<img_3763>\n\nFigure 8 (a)\n\n<img_3147>\n\nFigure 8 (b)\n\nIn the remaining case the minimal bounding rectangle of the chain is of size $a \\times b$ where $a, b \\geqslant 3$. Denote by $\\ell$ the length of the chain (i.e. the number of cells in the chain).\n\nIf the chain has at least two diagonal links (see Figure 9), then $\\ell \\leqslant a+b-3 \\leqslant a b / 3$.\n\nIf the chain has only one diagonal link then $\\ell=a+b-2$. In this case the chain has horizontal and vertical end-links, and we expand the minimal bounding rectangle in two directions to get an $(a+1) \\times(b+1)$ rectangle. On Figure 10 a corresponding expansion of the minimal bounding rectangle is coloured in light red. Again the length of the chain does not exceed $1 / 3$ of the rectangle's area: $\\ell \\leqslant a+b-2 \\leqslant(a+1)(b+1) / 3$.\n\nOn the next step we will use the following statement: all cells in constructed rectangles are coloured red, green or blue (the cells upwards and to the right of green cells are blue; the cells downwards and to the left of green cells are red). The proof repeats the same arguments as before (see Figure 8(b).)\n\n<img_3252>\n\nFigure 9\n\n<img_3629>\n\nFigure 10\n\n<img_3644>\n\n(a)\n\n<img_3861>\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11\n\nNote that all constructed rectangles are disjoint. Indeed, assume that two rectangles have a common cell. Using the above statement, one can see that the only such cell can be a common corner cell, as shown in Figure 11. Moreover, in this case both rectangles should be expanded, otherwise they would share a green corner cell.\n\nIf they were expanded along the same axis (see Figure 11(a)), then again the common corner cannot be coloured correctly. If they were expanded along different axes (see Figure 11(b)) then the two chains have a common point and must be connected in one chain. (These arguments work for $2 \\times 3$ and $1 \\times 3$ rectangles in a similar manner.)"

            "Let $Q$ be the isogonal conjugate of $D$ with respect to the triangle $A B C$. Since $\\angle B A D=\\angle D A C$, the point $Q$ lies on $A D$. Then $\\angle Q B A=\\angle D B C=\\angle F D A$, so the points $Q, D, F$, and $B$ are concyclic. Analogously, the points $Q, D, E$, and $C$ are concyclic. Thus $A F \\cdot A B=A D \\cdot A Q=A E \\cdot A C$ and so the points $B, F, E$, and $C$ are also concyclic.\n\n<img_3350>\n\nLet $T$ be the intersection of $B C$ and $F E$.\n\nClaim. $T D^{2}=T B \\cdot T C=T F \\cdot T E$.\n\nProof. We will prove that the circles $(D E F)$ and $(B D C)$ are tangent to each other. Indeed, using the above arguments, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\angle B D F=\\angle A F D-\\angle A B D=\\left(180^{\\circ}-\\angle F A D-\\angle F D A\\right)-(\\angle A B C-\\angle D B C) \\\\\n= & 180^{\\circ}-\\angle F A D-\\angle A B C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle D A E-\\angle F E A=\\angle F E D+\\angle A D E=\\angle F E D+\\angle D C B,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the desired tangency.\n\nSince the points $B, C, E$, and $F$ are concyclic, the powers of the point $T$ with respect to the circles $(B D C)$ and $(E D F)$ are equal. So their radical axis, which coincides with the common tangent at $D$, passes through $T$, and hence $T D^{2}=T E \\cdot T F=T B \\cdot T C$.\n\n\nNotice that $\\angle A Q E=\\angle Q C B$ and $\\angle A Q F=\\angle Q B C$; so, if we replace the point $D$ with $Q$ in the problem set up, the points $E, F$, and $T$ remain the same. So, by the Claim, we have $T Q^{2}=T B \\cdot T C=T D^{2}$.\n\nThus, there exists a circle $\\Gamma$ centred at $T$ and passing through $D$ and $Q$. We denote the second meeting point of the circles $\\Gamma$ and $(A D C)$ by $K$. Let the line $A C$ meet the circle $(D E K)$ again at $Y$; we intend to prove that $Y=X$. this will yield that the point $T$, as well as the centres $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$, all lie on the perpendicular bisector of $D K$.\n\nLet $L=A D \\cap B C$. We perform an inversion centred at $C$; the images of the points will be denoted by primes, e.g., $A^{\\prime}$ is the image of $A$. We obtain the following configuration, constructed in a triangle $A^{\\prime} C L^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe points $D^{\\prime}$ and $Q^{\\prime}$ are chosen on the circumcircle $\\Omega$ of $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} C$ such that $\\sphericalangle\\left(L^{\\prime} C, D^{\\prime} C\\right)=$ $\\sphericalangle\\left(Q^{\\prime} C, A^{\\prime} C\\right)$, which means that $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} \\| D^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$. The lines $D^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$ and $A^{\\prime} C$ meet at $E^{\\prime}$.\n\nA circle $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ centred on $C L^{\\prime}$ passes through $D^{\\prime}$ and $Q^{\\prime}$. Notice here that $B^{\\prime}$ lies on the segment $C L^{\\prime}$, and that $\\angle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C=\\angle B A C=2 \\angle L A C=2 \\angle A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} C$, so that $B^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}=B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$, and $B^{\\prime}$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}$ (which coincides with that of $D^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$ ). All this means that $B^{\\prime}$ is the centre of $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$.\n\nFinally, $K^{\\prime}$ is the second meeting point of $A^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$, and $Y^{\\prime}$ is the second meeting point of the circle $\\left(D^{\\prime} K^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}\\right)$ and the line $A^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}$, We have $\\sphericalangle\\left(Y^{\\prime} K^{\\prime}, K^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(Y^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}, E^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}\\right)=$ $\\sphericalangle\\left(Y^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}, A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}\\right)$, so $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}$ is tangent to the circumcircle $\\omega$ of the triangle $Y^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} K^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet $O$ and $O^{*}$ be the centres of $\\Omega$ and $\\omega$, respectively. Then $O^{*} A^{\\prime} \\perp A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} \\perp B^{\\prime} O$. The projections of vectors $\\overrightarrow{O^{*} A^{\\prime}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{B^{\\prime} O}$ onto $K^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ are equal to $\\overrightarrow{K^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}} / 2=\\overrightarrow{K^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}} / 2-\\overrightarrow{A^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}} / 2$. So $\\overrightarrow{O^{*} A^{\\prime}}=\\overrightarrow{B^{\\prime} O}$, or equivalently $\\overrightarrow{A^{\\prime} O}=\\overrightarrow{O^{*} B^{\\prime}}$. Projecting this equality onto $A^{\\prime} C$, we see that the projection of $\\overrightarrow{O^{*} B^{\\prime}}$ equals $\\overrightarrow{A^{\\prime} C} / 2$. Since $O^{*}$ is projected to the midpoint of $A^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}$, this yields that $B^{\\prime}$ is projected to the midpoint of $C Y^{\\prime}$, i.e., $B^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=B^{\\prime} C$ and $\\angle B^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} C=\\angle B^{\\prime} C Y^{\\prime}$. In the original figure, this rewrites as $\\angle C B Y=\\angle B C Y$, so $Y$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $B C$, as desired.\n\n<img_3172>"

The sequence $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ is bounded.\n\nProof. Suppose the contrary. Then there exist infinitely many indices $n$ such that $a_{n}$ is greater than each of the previous terms $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$. Let $a_{n}=k$ be such a term, $n>10$.

It follows from Lemma 1 that $a_{n-1}$ divides $a_{n-1-3 s}$ for $3 s<n-1$ and $a_{n-2}$ divides $a_{n-2-6 s}$ for $6 s<n-2$. Since at least one of the numbers $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$ is at least $a_{n} / 2$, so is some $a_{i}$ with $i \\leqslant 6$. However, $a_{n}$ can be arbitrarily large, a contradiction.\n\nSince $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ is bounded, there exist only finitely many $i$ for which $a_{i}$ appears in the sequence finitely many times. In other words, there exists $N$ such that if $a_{i}=t$ and $i>N$, then $a_{j}=t$ for infinitely many $j$.\n\nClearly the sequence $\\left(a_{n+N}\\right)_{n>0}$ satisfies the divisibility condition, and it is enough to prove that this sequence is eventually periodic. Thus truncating the sequence if necessary, we can assume that each number appears infinitely many times in the sequence. Let $k$ be the maximum number appearing in the sequence.\n\nLemma 2. If a positive integer $d$ divides $a_{n}$ for some $n$, then the numbers $i$ such that $d$ divides $a_{i}$ form an arithmetical progression with an odd difference.\n\nProof. Let $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}<\\ldots$ be all the indices $i$ such that $d$ divides $a_{i}$. If $i_{s}+i_{s+1}$ is even, it follows from Lemma 1 that $d$ also divides $\\frac{a_{i_{s}+i_{s+1}}^{2}}{}$, impossible since $i_{s}<\\frac{i_{s}+i_{s+1}}{2}<i_{s+1}$. Thus $i_{s}$ and $i_{s+1}$ are always of different parity, and therefore $i_{s}+i_{s+2}$ is even. Applying Lemma 1 again, we see that $d$ divides $\\frac{a_{i_{s}+i_{s+2}}}{2}$, hence $\\frac{i_{s}+i_{s+2}}{2}=i_{s+1}$,\n\nWe are ready now to solve the problem.\n\nThe number of positive divisors of all terms of the progression is finite. Let $d_{s}$ be the difference of the progression corresponding to $s$, that is, $s$ divides $a_{n}$ if and only if it divides $a_{n+t d_{s}}$ for any positive integer $t$. Let $D$ be the product of all $d_{s}$. Then each $s$ dividing a term of the progression divides $a_{n}$ if and only if it divides $a_{n+D}$. This means that the sets of divisors of $a_{n}$ and $a_{n+D}$ coincide, and $a_{n+D}=a_{n}$. Thus $D$ is a period of the sequence."

We consider three easy subcases.\n\nSubcase 2.1: $b_{k}>1$.\n\nThen $a_{k+1} \\geqslant b_{k} a_{k}-a_{k-1} \\geqslant a_{k}+\\left(a_{k}-a_{k-1}\\right)>a_{k} \\geqslant 1$.\n\nSubcase 2.2: $b_{k}=b_{k-1}=1$.\n\nThen $a_{k+1}=a_{k}+a_{k-1}>a_{k} \\geqslant 1$.\n\nSubcase 2.3: $b_{k}=1$ but $b_{k-1}>1$.\n\nThen $k+1$ is bad, and we need to prove only (a), which is trivial: $a_{k+1}=a_{k}-a_{k-1} \\geqslant 1$.\n\nSo, in all three subcases we have verified the required relations.\n\nLemma 2. Assume that $n>1$ is bad. Then there exists a $j \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ such that $a_{n+j} \\geqslant$ $a_{n-1}+j+1$, and $a_{n+i} \\geqslant a_{n-1}+i$ for all $1 \\leqslant i<j$.\n\nProof.

Again, we distinguish several cases, according to the value of $m$; in each of them we use Lemma 1 without reference.\n\nCase 1: $m=1$, so $b_{n}>1$.\n\nThen $a_{n+1} \\geqslant 2 a_{n}+a_{n-1} \\geqslant a_{n-1}+2$, as required.\n\nCase 2: $m=2$, so $b_{n}=1$ and $b_{n+1}>1$.\n\nThen we successively get\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\na_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1} \\geqslant a_{n-1}+1 \\\\\na_{n+2} \\geqslant 2 a_{n+1}+a_{n} \\geqslant 2\\left(a_{n-1}+1\\right)+a_{n}=a_{n-1}+\\left(a_{n-1}+a_{n}+2\\right) \\geqslant a_{n-1}+4\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhich is even better than we need.\n\n\n\nCase 3: $m>2$, so $b_{n}=b_{n+1}=1$.\n\nThen we successively get\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\na_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1} \\geqslant a_{n-1}+1, \\quad a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+a_{n} \\geqslant a_{n-1}+1+a_{n} \\geqslant a_{n-1}+2, \\\\\na_{n+3} \\geqslant a_{n+2}+a_{n+1} \\geqslant\\left(a_{n-1}+1\\right)+\\left(a_{n-1}+2\\right) \\geqslant a_{n-1}+4\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nLemmas 1(b) and 2 provide enough information to prove that $\\max \\left\\{a_{n}, a_{n+1}\\right\\} \\geqslant n$ for all $n$ and, moreover, that $a_{n} \\geqslant n$ often enough.

We split the solution into a sequence of lemmas, strengthening one another. We always consider some value of $x$ with $g(x) \\neq 2 x$ and denote $X=g(x)$.\n\nLemma 1. Assume that $X<2 x$. Then on the interval $(X-x ; x]$ the function $g$ attains at most two values - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y>X$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ attains at most two values on $[x ; X-x)$ - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y<X$.\n\nProof. We start with the first claim of the lemma. Notice that $X-x<x$, so the considered interval is nonempty.\n\nTake any $a \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \\neq X$ (if it exists). If $g(a)<X$, then (*) yields $g(a) \\leqslant$ $a+x \\leqslant g(x)=X$, so $a \\leqslant X-x$ which is impossible. Thus, $g(a)>X$ and hence by $(*)$ we get $X \\leqslant a+x \\leqslant g(a)$.\n\nNow, for any $b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(b) \\neq X$ we similarly get $b+x \\leqslant g(b)$. Therefore, the number $a+b$ (which is smaller than each of $a+x$ and $b+x$ ) cannot lie between $g(a)$ and $g(b)$, which by $(*)$ implies that $g(a)=g(b)$. Hence $g$ may attain only two values on $(X-x ; x]$, namely $X$ and $g(a)>X$.\n\nTo prove the second claim, notice that $g_{1}(-x)=-X<2 \\cdot(-x)$, so $g_{1}$ attains at most two values on $(-X+x,-x]$, i.e., $-X$ and, possibly, some $-Y>-X$. Passing back to $g$, we get what we need.\n\nLemma 2. If $X<2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(x ; X-x)$.\n\nProof. Again, it suffices to prove the first claim only. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist $a, b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \\neq g(b)$; by Lemma 1 , we may assume that $g(a)=X$ and $Y=g(b)>X$.\n\nNotice that $\\min \\{X-a, X-b\\}>X-x$, so there exists a $u \\in(X-x ; x)$ such that $u<\\min \\{X-a, X-b\\}$. By Lemma 1, we have either $g(u)=X$ or $g(u)=Y$. In the former case, by (*) we have $X \\leqslant u+b \\leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-b$. In the second case, by (*) we have $X \\leqslant u+a \\leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-a$. Thus the lemma is proved.\n\n\n\nLemma 3. If $X<2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \\in(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \\in(x ; X-x)$.\n\nProof. Again, we only prove the first claim.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, this claim may be violated only if $g$ takes on a constant value $Y>X$ on $(X-x, x)$. Choose any $a, b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $a<b$. By $(*)$, we have\n\n$$\nY \\geqslant b+x \\geqslant X\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIn particular, we have $Y \\geqslant b+x>2 a$. Applying Lemma 2 to $a$ in place of $x$, we obtain that $g$ is constant on $(a, Y-a)$. By (2) again, we have $x \\leqslant Y-b<Y-a$; so $x, b \\in(a ; Y-a)$. But $X=g(x) \\neq g(b)=Y$, which is a contradiction.\n\nNow we are able to finish the solution. Assume that $g(x)>g(y)$ for some $x<y$. Denote $X=g(x)$ and $Y=g(y)$; by $(*)$, we have $X \\geqslant x+y \\geqslant Y$, so $Y-y \\leqslant x<y \\leqslant X-x$, and hence $(Y-y ; y) \\cap(x ; X-x)=(x, y) \\neq \\varnothing$. On the other hand, since $Y-y<y$ and $x<X-x$, Lemma 3 shows that $g$ should attain a constant value $X$ on $(x ; X-x)$ and a constant value $Y \\neq X$ on $(Y-y ; y)$. Since these intervals overlap, we get the final contradiction.",
            "As in the previous solution, we pass to the function $g$ satisfying $(*)$ and notice that we need to prove the condition (1). We will also make use of the function $g_{1}$.\n\nIf $g$ is constant, then (1) is clearly satisfied. So, in the sequel we assume that $g$ takes on at least two different values. Now we collect some information about the function $g$.\n\nClaim 1. For any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, all the solutions of $g(x)=c$ are bounded.\n\nProof. Fix any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $g(y) \\neq c$. Assume first that $g(y)>c$. Now, for any $x$ with $g(x)=c$, by $(*)$ we have $c \\leqslant x+y \\leqslant g(y)$, or $c-y \\leqslant x \\leqslant g(y)-y$. Since $c$ and $y$ are constant, we get what we need.\n\nIf $g(y)<c$, we may switch to the function $g_{1}$ for which we have $g_{1}(-y)>-c$. By the above arguments, we obtain that all the solutions of $g_{1}(-x)=-c$ are bounded, which is equivalent to what we need.\n\nAs an immediate consequence, the function $g$ takes on infinitely many values, which shows that the next claim is indeed widely applicable.\n\nClaim 2. If $g(x)<g(y)<g(z)$, then $x<z$.\n\nProof. By $(*)$, we have $g(x) \\leqslant x+y \\leqslant g(y) \\leqslant z+y \\leqslant g(z)$, so $x+y \\leqslant z+y$, as required.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that $g(x)>g(y)$ for some $x<y$. Then $g(a) \\in\\{g(x), g(y)\\}$ for all $a \\in[x ; y]$.\n\nProof. If $g(y)<g(a)<g(x)$, then the triple $(y, a, x)$ violates Claim 2. If $g(a)<g(y)<g(x)$, then the triple $(a, y, x)$ violates Claim 2. If $g(y)<g(x)<g(a)$, then the triple $(y, x, a)$ violates Claim 2. The only possible cases left are $g(a) \\in\\{g(x), g(y)\\}$.\n\nIn view of Claim 3, we say that an interval $I$ (which may be open, closed, or semi-open) is a Dirichlet interval* if the function $g$ takes on just two values on $I$.\n\nAssume now, for the sake of contradiction, that (1) is violated by some $x<y$. By Claim 3, $[x ; y]$ is a Dirichlet interval. Set\n\n$r=\\inf \\{a:(a ; y]$ is a Dirichlet interval $\\}$ and $s=\\sup \\{b:[x ; b)$ is a Dirichlet interval $\\}$.\n\nClearly, $r \\leqslant x<y \\leqslant s$. By Claim $1, r$ and $s$ are finite. Denote $X=g(x), Y=g(y)$, and $\\Delta=(y-x) / 2$.\n\nSuppose first that there exists a $t \\in(r ; r+\\Delta)$ with $f(t)=Y$. By the definition of $r$, the interval $(r-\\Delta ; y]$ is not Dirichlet, so there exists an $r^{\\prime} \\in(r-\\Delta ; r]$ such that $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right) \\notin\\{X, Y\\}$.[^0]\n\n\n[^0]:    *The name Dirichlet interval is chosen for the reason that $g$ theoretically might act similarly to the Dirichlet function on this interval.\n\n\n\nThe function $g$ attains at least three distinct values on $\\left[r^{\\prime} ; y\\right]$, namely $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right), g(x)$, and $g(y)$. Claim 3 now yields $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant g(y)$; the equality is impossible by the choice of $r^{\\prime}$, so in fact $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right)<Y$. Applying $(*)$ to the pairs $\\left(r^{\\prime}, y\\right)$ and $(t, x)$ we obtain $r^{\\prime}+y \\leqslant Y \\leqslant t+x$, whence $r-\\Delta+y<r^{\\prime}+y \\leqslant t+x<r+\\Delta+x$, or $y-x<2 \\Delta$. This is a contradiction.\n\nThus, $g(t)=X$ for all $t \\in(r ; r+\\Delta)$. Applying the same argument to $g_{1}$, we get $g(t)=Y$ for all $t \\in(s-\\Delta ; s)$.\n\nFinally, choose some $s_{1}, s_{2} \\in(s-\\Delta ; s)$ with $s_{1}<s_{2}$ and denote $\\delta=\\left(s_{2}-s_{1}\\right) / 2$. As before, we choose $r^{\\prime} \\in(r-\\delta ; r)$ with $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right) \\notin\\{X, Y\\}$ and obtain $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right)<Y$. Choose any $t \\in(r ; r+\\delta)$; by the above arguments, we have $g(t)=X$ and $g\\left(s_{1}\\right)=g\\left(s_{2}\\right)=Y$. As before, we apply (*) to the pairs $\\left(r^{\\prime}, s_{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(t, s_{1}\\right)$ obtaining $r-\\delta+s_{2}<r^{\\prime}+s_{2} \\leqslant Y \\leqslant t+s_{1}<r+\\delta+s_{1}$, or $s_{2}-s_{1}<2 \\delta$.

For any chameleon $X$ and any pair of distinct letters $u, v \\in\\{a, b, c\\}$, we define $f_{u, v}(X)$ to be the number of pairs of positions in $X$ such that the left one is occupied by $u$, and the right one is occupied by $v$.

We have\n\n$f_{X * Y}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash(X * Y)=\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash X\\right) \\backslash f_{X}(Y)=f_{X}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right) \\backslash f_{X}(Y)=f_{X}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash Y\\right)=f_{X}\\left(f_{Y}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nThus, the functions $f_{X * Y}$ and $f_{X} \\circ f_{Y}$ are strictly increasing functions with the same range. Because a strictly function is uniquely defined by its range, we have $f_{X * Y}=f_{X} \\circ f_{Y}$.\n\nLemma 1 implies that $*$ is associative, in the sense that $(A * B) * C=A *(B * C)$ for any finite sets $A, B$, and $C$ of positive integers. We prove the associativity by noting\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash((A * B) * C)=f_{(A * B) * C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=f_{A * B}\\left(f_{C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)\\right)=f_{A}\\left(f_{B}\\left(f_{C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\\\\n=f_{A}\\left(f_{B * C}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=f_{A *(B * C)}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right)=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\backslash(A *(B * C))\\right.\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIn light of the associativity of $*$, we may drop the parentheses when we write expressions like $A *(B * C)$. We also introduce the notation\n\n$$\nX^{* k}=\\underbrace{X *(X * \\cdots *(X *(X * X)) \\ldots)}_{X \\text { appears } k \\text { times }} .\n$$\n\nOur goal is then to show that $A * B=B * A$ implies $A^{* b}=B^{* a}$. We will do so via the following general lemma.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are finite sets of positive integers satisfying $X * Y=Y * X$ and $|X|=|Y|$. Then, we must have $X=Y$.\n\nProof. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are not equal. Let $s$ be the largest number in exactly one of $X$ and $Y$. Without loss of generality, say that $s \\in X \\backslash Y$. The number $f_{X}(s)$ counts the $s^{t h}$ number not in $X$, which implies that\n\n$$\nf_{X}(s)=s+\\left|X \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nSince $f_{X}(s) \\geqslant s$, we have that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cap X=\\left\\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cap Y\n$$\n\nwhich, together with the assumption that $|X|=|Y|$, gives\n\n$$\n\\left|X \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|=\\left|Y \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\n\n\nNow consider the equation\n\n$$\nt-|Y \\cap\\{1,2, \\ldots, t\\}|=s\n$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied only when $t \\in\\left[f_{Y}(s), f_{Y}(s+1)\\right)$, because the left hand side counts the number of elements up to $t$ that are not in $Y$. We have that the value $t=f_{X}(s)$ satisfies the above equation because of (1) and (2). Furthermore, since $f_{X}(s) \\notin X$ and $f_{X}(s) \\geqslant s$, we have that $f_{X}(s) \\notin Y$ due to the maximality of $s$. Thus, by the above discussion, we must have $f_{X}(s)=f_{Y}(s)$.\n\nFinally, we arrive at a contradiction. The value $f_{X}(s)$ is neither in $X$ nor in $f_{X}(Y)$, because $s$ is not in $Y$ by assumption. Thus, $f_{X}(s) \\notin X * Y$. However, since $s \\in X$, we have $f_{Y}(s) \\in Y * X$, a contradiction.\n\nWe are now ready to finish the proof. Note first of all that $\\left|A^{* b}\\right|=a b=\\left|B^{* a}\\right|$. Moreover, since $A * B=B * A$, and $*$ is associative, it follows that $A^{* b} * B^{* a}=B^{* a} * A^{* b}$. Thus, by Lemma 2 , we have $A^{* b}=B^{* a}$, as desired."

It remains to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ under $t$ are consecutive.\n\nFor this purpose, let $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ be three vertices in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ such that $C_{2}$ is between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $t\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ and $t\\left(C_{3}\\right)$ lie in $\\mathcal{B}$; we need to prove that $t\\left(C_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{B}$ as well. Let $A_{i}=t\\left(C_{i}\\right)$. The line through $C_{2}$ parallel to $\\vec{v}$ crosses the segment $C_{1} C_{3}$ to the right of $C_{2}$; this means that this line crosses $A_{1} A_{3}$ to the right of $A_{2}$, so $A_{2}$ lies inside the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$ which is contained in $\\mathcal{B}$. This yields the desired result.\n\nCase 2: $\\mathcal{C}$ is a homothetic image of $\\mathcal{A}$ centered at $X$ with factor $k>0$.\n\n\n\nDenote by $h$ the homothety mapping $\\mathcal{C}$ to $\\mathcal{A}$. We need now to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ after applying $h$ are consecutive. If $X \\in \\mathcal{B}$, the claim is easy. Indeed, if $k<1$, then the vertices of $\\mathcal{A}$ lie on the segments of the form $X C$ ( $C$ being a vertex of $\\mathcal{C})$ which lie in $\\mathcal{B}$. If $k>1$, then the vertices of $\\mathcal{A}$ lie on the extensions of such segments $X C$ beyond $C$, and almost all these extensions lie outside $\\mathcal{B}$. The exceptions may occur only in case when $X$ lies on the boundary of $\\mathcal{B}$, and they may cause one or two vertices of $\\mathcal{A}$ stay on the boundary of $\\mathcal{B}$. But even in this case those vertices are still consecutive.\n\nSo, from now on we assume that $X \\notin \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nNow, there are two vertices $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ of $\\mathcal{B}$ such that $\\mathcal{B}$ is contained in the angle $\\angle B_{\\mathrm{T}} X B_{\\mathrm{B}}$; if there are several options, say, for $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$, then we choose the farthest one from $X$ if $k>1$, and the nearest one if $k<1$. For the visualization purposes, we refer the plane to Cartesian coordinates so that the $y$-axis is co-directional with $\\overrightarrow{B_{\\mathrm{B}} B_{\\mathrm{T}}}$, and $X$ lies to the left of the line $B_{\\mathrm{T}} B_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Again, the perimeter of $\\mathcal{B}$ is split by $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{B}}$ into the right part $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and the left part $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$, and the set of vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ is split into two subsets $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n\n<img_3597>\n\nCase $2, X$ inside $\\mathcal{B}$\n\n<img_3767>\n\nSubcase 2.1: $k>1$\n\nSubcase 2.1: $k>1$.\n\nIn this subcase, all points from $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ (and hence from $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ ) move out from $\\mathcal{B}$ under $h$, because they are the farthest points of $\\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding rays emanated from $X$. It remains to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ under $h$ are consecutive.\n\nAgain, let $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ be three vertices in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ such that $C_{2}$ is between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $h\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ and $h\\left(C_{3}\\right)$ lie in $\\mathcal{B}$. Let $A_{i}=h\\left(C_{i}\\right)$. Then the ray $X C_{2}$ crosses the segment $C_{1} C_{3}$ beyond $C_{2}$, so this ray crosses $A_{1} A_{3}$ beyond $A_{2}$; this implies that $A_{2}$ lies in the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n<img_3986>\n\nSubcase $2.2: k<1$\n\nSubcase 2.2: $k<1$.\n\nThis case is completely similar to the previous one. All points from $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (and hence from $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ move out from $\\mathcal{B}$ under $h$, because they are the nearest points of $\\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding\n\n\n\nrays emanated from $X$. Assume that $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are three vertices in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ such that $C_{2}$ lies between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $h\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ and $h\\left(C_{3}\\right)$ lie in $\\mathcal{B}$; let $A_{i}=h\\left(C_{i}\\right)$. Then $A_{2}$ lies on the segment $X C_{2}$, and the segments $X A_{2}$ and $A_{1} A_{3}$ cross each other. Thus $A_{2}$ lies in the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{B}$.",

Say that a subset $I \\subseteq[n]$ is connected if the elements of this set are consecutive in the cyclic order (in other words, if we join each $i$ with $i+1 \\bmod n$ by an edge, this subset is connected in the usual graph sense). Clearly, the union of two connected subsets sharing at least one element is connected too. Next, for any half-plane $\\mathcal{H}$ the indices of vertices of, say, $\\mathcal{A}$ that lie in $\\mathcal{H}$ form a connected set.\n\nTo access the problem, we denote\n\n$$\nM=\\left\\{j \\in[n]: A_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{B}\\right\\}, \\quad M_{i}=\\left\\{j \\in[n]: A_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{H}_{i}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { for } i \\in[n]\n$$\n\nWe need to prove that $[n] \\backslash M$ is connected, which is equivalent to $M$ being connected. On the other hand, since $\\mathcal{B}=\\bigcap_{i \\in[n]} \\mathcal{H}_{i}$, we have $M=\\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} M_{i}$, where the sets $M_{i}$ are easier to investigate. We will utilize the following properties of these sets; the first one holds by the definition of $M_{i}$, along with the above remark.\n\n\n\n<img_3628>\n\nThe sets $M_{i}$\n\nProperty 1: Each set $M_{i}$ is connected.\n\nProperty 2: If $M_{i}$ is nonempty, then $i \\in M_{i}$.\n\nProof. Indeed, we have\n\n$$\nj \\in M_{i} \\Longleftrightarrow A_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{H}_{i} \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{B_{i} A_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<0 \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{A} A_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{A} B_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nThe right-hand part of the last inequality does not depend on $j$. Therefore, if some $j$ lies in $M_{i}$, then by (1) so does $i$.\n\nIn view of Property 2, it is useful to define the set\n\n$$\nM^{\\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: i \\in M_{i}\\right\\}=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: M_{i} \\neq \\varnothing\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProperty 3: The set $M^{\\prime}$ is connected.\n\nProof. To prove this property, we proceed on with the investigation started in (2) to write\n\n$$\ni \\in M^{\\prime} \\Longleftrightarrow A_{i} \\in M_{i} \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{B_{i} A_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<0 \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{B} O_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{B} B_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{A_{i} O_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe right-hand part of the obtained inequality does not depend on $i$, due to the rotational symmetry; denote its constant value by $\\mu$. Thus, $i \\in M^{\\prime}$ if and only if $\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{B} O_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<\\mu$. This condition is in turn equivalent to the fact that $B_{i}$ lies in a certain (open) half-plane whose boundary line is orthogonal to $O_{B} O_{A}$; thus, it defines a connected set.\n\nNow we can finish the solution. Since $M^{\\prime} \\subseteq M$, we have\n\n$$\nM=\\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} M_{i}=M^{\\prime} \\cup \\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} M_{i}\n$$\n\nso $M$ can be obtained from $M^{\\prime}$ by adding all the sets $M_{i}$ one by one. All these sets are connected, and each nonempty $M_{i}$ contains an element of $M^{\\prime}$ (namely, $i$ ). Thus their union is also connected."

Let the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$ be tangent to the line $A C$ at $T$ and $T^{\\prime}$, respectively. (See the figure to the left.) We have $A T=\\frac{A B+A C-B C}{2}$ in triangle $A B C, A T^{\\prime}=$ $\\frac{A D+A C-C D}{2}$ in triangle $A C D$, and $A B-B C=A D-C D$ in quadrilateral $A B C D$, so\n\n$$\nA T=\\frac{A C+A B-B C}{2}=\\frac{A C+A D-C D}{2}=A T^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThis shows $T=T^{\\prime}$. As an immediate consequence, $I_{b} I_{d} \\perp A C$.\n\nThe second statement can be shown analogously.\n<img_3666>\n\nClaim 2. The points $O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c}$ and $O_{d}$ lie on the lines $A I, B I, C I$ and $D I$, respectively.\n\nProof. By symmetry it suffices to prove the claim for $O_{a}$. (See the figure to the right above.)\n\nNotice first that the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$ can be obtained from the incircle of the quadrilateral $A B C D$ with homothety centers $B$ and $D$, respectively, and homothety factors less than 1 , therefore the points $I_{b}$ and $I_{d}$ lie on the line segments $B I$ and $D I$, respectively.\n\nAs is well-known, in every triangle the altitude and the diameter of the circumcircle starting from the same vertex are symmetric about the angle bisector. By Claim 1, in triangle $A I_{d} I_{b}$, the segment $A T$ is the altitude starting from $A$. Since the foot $T$ lies inside the segment $I_{b} I_{d}$, the circumcenter $O_{a}$ of triangle $A I_{d} I_{b}$ lies in the angle domain $I_{b} A I_{d}$ in such a way that $\\angle I_{b} A T=\\angle O_{a} A I_{d}$. The points $I_{b}$ and $I_{d}$ are the incenters of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$, so the lines $A I_{b}$ and $A I_{d}$ bisect the angles $\\angle B A C$ and $\\angle C A D$, respectively. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle O_{a} A D=\\angle O_{a} A I_{d}+\\angle I_{d} A D=\\angle I_{b} A T+\\angle I_{d} A D=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A C+\\frac{1}{2} \\angle C A D=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A D\n$$\n\nso $O_{a}$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle B A D$, that is, on line $A I$.\n\nThe point $X$ is the external similitude center of $\\omega_{a}$ and $\\omega_{c}$; let $U$ be their internal similitude center. The points $O_{a}$ and $O_{c}$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of the common chord $I_{b} I_{d}$ of $\\omega_{a}$ and $\\omega_{c}$, and the two similitude centers $X$ and $U$ lie on the same line; by Claim 2, that line is parallel to $A C$.\n\n\n\n<img_3882>\n\nFrom the similarity of the circles $\\omega_{a}$ and $\\omega_{c}$, from $O_{a} I_{b}=O_{a} I_{d}=O_{a} A=r_{a}$ and $O_{c} I_{b}=$ $O_{c} I_{d}=O_{c} C=r_{c}$, and from $A C \\| O_{a} O_{c}$ we can see that\n\n$$\n\\frac{O_{a} X}{O_{c} X}=\\frac{O_{a} U}{O_{c} U}=\\frac{r_{a}}{r_{c}}=\\frac{O_{a} I_{b}}{O_{c} I_{b}}=\\frac{O_{a} I_{d}}{O_{c} I_{d}}=\\frac{O_{a} A}{O_{c} C}=\\frac{O_{a} I}{O_{c} I}\n$$\n\nSo the points $X, U, I_{b}, I_{d}, I$ lie on the Apollonius circle of the points $O_{a}, O_{c}$ with ratio $r_{a}: r_{c}$. In this Apollonius circle $X U$ is a diameter, and the lines $I U$ and $I X$ are respectively the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle O_{a} I O_{c}=\\angle A I C$, according to the angle bisector theorem. Moreover, in the Apollonius circle the diameter $U X$ is the perpendicular bisector of $I_{b} I_{d}$, so the lines $I X$ and $I U$ are the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle I_{b} I I_{d}=\\angle B I D$, respectively.\n\nRepeating the same argument for the points $B, D$ instead of $A, C$, we get that the line $I Y$ is the internal bisector of $\\angle A I C$ and the external bisector of $\\angle B I D$. Therefore, the lines $I X$ and $I Y$ respectively are the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle B I D$, so they are perpendicular."

First, if $a$ is a power of a prime $\\left(a=p^{k}\\right)$, then we may choose either:\n\n- $f_{a}(x, y)=\\left(x^{p-1}+y^{p-1}\\right)^{\\phi(a)}$ if $p$ is odd;\n- $f_{a}(x, y)=\\left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}\\right)^{\\phi(a)}$ if $p=2$.\n\nNow suppose $a$ is any positive integer, and let $a=q_{1} q_{2} \\cdots q_{k}$, where the $q_{i}$ are prime powers, pairwise relatively prime. Let $f_{q_{i}}$ be the polynomials just constructed, and let $F_{q_{i}}$ be powers of these that all have the same degree. Note that\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{q_{i}} F_{q_{i}}(x, y) \\equiv \\frac{a}{q_{i}}(\\bmod a)\n$$\n\nfor any relatively prime $x, y$. By Bézout's lemma, there is an integer linear combination of the $\\frac{a}{q_{i}}$ that equals 1 . Thus, there is a linear combination of the $F_{q_{i}}$ such that $F_{q_{i}}(x, y) \\equiv 1$ $(\\bmod a)$ for any relatively prime $(x, y)$; and this polynomial is homogenous because all the $F_{q_{i}}$ have the same degree.",
            "As in the previous solution, label the irreducible lattice points $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\\right)$ and assume without loss of generality that no two of the points are collinear with the origin. We induct on $n$ to construct a homogenous polynomial $f(x, y)$ such that $f\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)=1$ for all $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$.\n\nIf $n=1$ : Since $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$ are relatively prime, there exist some integers $c, d$ such that $c x_{1}+d y_{1}=1$.

Prove that after some years there will be an island which is connected to all other islands by ferry routes.",
        "solution": [
            "Initially, we pick any pair of islands $A$ and $B$ which are connected by a ferry route and put $A$ in set $\\mathcal{A}$ and $B$ in set $\\mathcal{B}$. From the condition, without loss of generality there must be another island which is connected to $A$. We put such an island $C$ in set $\\mathcal{B}$. We say that two sets of islands form a network if each island in one set is connected to each island in the other set.\n\nNext, we shall included all islands to $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$ one by one. Suppose we have two sets $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ which form a network where $3 \\leqslant|\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}|<n$. This relation no longer holds only when a ferry route between islands $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ is closed. In that case, we define $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}=\\{A, B\\}$, and $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}=(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B})-\\{A, B\\}$. Note that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is nonempty. Consider any island $C \\in \\mathcal{A}-\\{A\\}$. From the relation of $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$, we know that $C$ is connected to $B$. If $C$ was not connected to $A$ before the route between $A$ and $B$ closes, then there will be a route added between $C$ and $A$ afterwards. Hence, $C$ must now be connected to both $A$ and $B$. The same holds true for any island in $\\mathcal{B}-\\{B\\}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}$ and $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ form a network, and $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime} \\cup \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$. Hence these islands can always be partitioned into sets $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ which form a network.\n\nAs $|\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}|<n$, there are some islands which are not included in $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$. From the condition, after some years there must be a ferry route between an island $A$ in $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$ and an island $D$ outside $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$ which closes. Without loss of generality assume $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Then each island in $\\mathcal{B}$ must then be connected to $D$, no matter it was or not before. Hence, we can put $D$ in set $\\mathcal{A}$ so that the new sets $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ still form a network and the size of $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$ is increased by 1 . The same process can be done to increase the size of $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$. Eventually, all islands are included in this way so we may now assume $|\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}|=n$.\n\nSuppose a ferry route between $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ is closed after some years. We put $A$ and $B$ in set $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}$ and all remaining islands in set $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. Then $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}$ and $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ form a network. This relation no longer holds only when a route between $A$, without loss of generality, and $C \\in \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is closed. Since this must eventually occur, at that time island $B$ will be connected to all other islands and the result follows."

However, if the snails arrive at $P$ at the same time, then there should be the same number of intersections on $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, which gives an even number of intersections.

For any point $A$ in $S$, the relation $B C \\geqslant A B \\geqslant A C$ always holds. Therefore, the point $A$ in (ii) is uniquely determined, while its existence is guaranteed by the above construction.\n\n<img_3425>\n\nNext, if in the similarity of $\\triangle A^{\\prime} B C$ and $\\triangle P_{\\sigma(1)} P_{\\sigma(2)} P_{\\sigma(3)}, B C$ corresponds to the second longest side of $\\triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$, then we have $A^{\\prime} B \\geqslant B C \\geqslant A^{\\prime} C$.

For (i), note that $S^{\\prime}$ contains points inside the disk $(x-1)^{2}+y^{2} \\leqslant 4$ and outside the disk $(x+1)^{2}+y^{2} \\geqslant 4$.

            "We first state two results which will be needed in our proof.\n\n- Claim 1. In $\\triangle X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ with $X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$, let $N^{\\prime}$ be the midpoint of $Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and $W^{\\prime}$ be the foot of internal angle bisector from $X^{\\prime}$. Then $\\tan ^{2} \\measuredangle W^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}=\\tan \\measuredangle N^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} W^{\\prime} \\tan \\measuredangle Z^{\\prime} W^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof.\n\n<img_3585>\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume $X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}>X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$. Then $W^{\\prime}$ lies between $N^{\\prime}$ and $Z^{\\prime}$. The signs of both sides agree so it suffices to establish the relation for ordinary angles. Let $\\angle W^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}=\\alpha, \\angle N^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} W^{\\prime}=\\beta$ and $\\angle Z^{\\prime} W^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}=\\gamma$.

Let $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in circle $\\Gamma$. Let diagonals $A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ meet at $E^{\\prime}$, and $F^{\\prime}$ be the intersection of lines $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$. Let $M^{\\prime}$ be the midpoint of $E^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$. Then the power of $M^{\\prime}$ with respect to $\\Gamma$ is equal to $\\left(M^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$.\n\nProof.\n\n<img_3656>\n\nLet $O^{\\prime}$ be the centre of $\\Gamma$ and let $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ be the circle with centre $M^{\\prime}$ passing through $E^{\\prime}$. Let $F_{1}$ be the inversion image of $F^{\\prime}$ with respect to $\\Gamma$. It is well-known that $E^{\\prime}$ lies on the polar of $F^{\\prime}$ with respect to $\\Gamma$. This shows $E^{\\prime} F_{1} \\perp O^{\\prime} F^{\\prime}$ and hence $F_{1}$ lies on $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$. It follows that the inversion image of $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ with respect to $\\Gamma$ is $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ itself. This shows $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ is orthogonal to $\\Gamma$, and thus the power of $M^{\\prime}$ with respect to $\\Gamma$ is the square of radius of $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$, which is $\\left(M^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$.\n\nWe return to the main problem. Let $Z$ be the intersection of lines $A D$ and $B C$, and $W$ be the intersection of lines $A B$ and $C D$. Since $\\measuredangle P D Z=\\measuredangle P B C=\\measuredangle P B Z$, point $Z$ lies on $\\omega$. Similarly, $W$ lies on $\\omega$. Applying Claim 2 to the cyclic quadrilateral $Z B D W$, we know that the power of $M$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $M A^{2}$. Hence, $M X \\cdot M B=M A^{2}$.\n\nSuppose the line through $B$ perpendicular to $B E$ meets line $A C$ at $T$. Then $B E$ and $B T$ are the angle bisectors of $\\angle C B A$. This shows $(T, E ; A, C)$ is harmonic. Thus, we have $M E \\cdot M T=M A^{2}=M X \\cdot M B$. It follows that $E, T, B, X$ are concyclic.\n\n\n\n<img_3636>\n\nThe result is trivial for the special case $A D=C D$ since $P, Q$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of $A C$ in that case. Similarly, the case $A B=C B$ is trivial. It remains to consider the general cases where we can apply Claim 1 in the latter part of the proof.\n\nLet the projections from $P$ and $Q$ to $A C$ be $P^{\\prime}$ and $Q^{\\prime}$ respectively. Then $P Q \\perp A C$ if and only if $P^{\\prime}=Q^{\\prime}$ if and only if $\\frac{E P^{\\prime}}{F P^{\\prime}}=\\frac{E Q^{\\prime}}{F Q^{\\prime}}$ in terms of directed lengths. Note that\n\n$$\n\\frac{E P^{\\prime}}{F P^{\\prime}}=\\frac{\\tan \\measuredangle E F P}{\\tan \\measuredangle F E P}=\\frac{\\tan \\measuredangle A F D}{\\tan \\measuredangle A E B}\n$$\n\nNext, we have $\\frac{E Q^{\\prime}}{F Q^{\\prime}}=\\frac{\\tan \\measuredangle E F Q}{\\tan \\measuredangle F E Q}$ where $\\measuredangle F E Q=\\measuredangle T E X=\\measuredangle T B X=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\measuredangle E B M$ and by symmetry $\\measuredangle E F Q=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\measuredangle F D M$. Combining all these, it suffices to show\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\tan \\measuredangle A F D}{\\tan \\measuredangle A E B}=\\frac{\\tan \\measuredangle M B E}{\\tan \\measuredangle M D F}\n$$\n\nWe now apply Claim 1 twice to get\n\n$$\n\\tan \\measuredangle A F D \\tan \\measuredangle M D F=\\tan ^{2} \\measuredangle F D C=\\tan ^{2} \\measuredangle E B A=\\tan \\measuredangle M B E \\tan \\measuredangle A E B .\n$$\n\nThe result then follows."

Take any $k \\in B$ so that (1) is satisfied for some integers $x, y$ with $0 \\leqslant x<\\sqrt{a}$. Clearly, $y \\neq 0$ and we may assume $y$ is positive. Since $a$ is not a square, we have $k>1$. Hence, we get $0 \\leqslant x<y<\\sqrt{a}$.

Take any $k \\in A$ so that (1) is satisfied for some integers $x, y$ with $x>\\sqrt{a}$. Again, we may assume $y$ is positive. Among all such representations of $k$, we choose the one with smallest $x+y$.

            "- Claim. If $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ is a solution to (2), then $\\left((2 k-1) x_{0} \\pm 2 k y_{0},(2 k-1) y_{0} \\pm 2(k-1) x_{0}\\right)$ is also a solution to (2).\n\nProof.

Also, we have $k>1$ since $a$ is not a square number. By the Claim, consider another solution to (2) defined by\n\n$$\nx_{1}=(2 k-1) x+2 k y, \\quad y_{1}=(2 k-1) y+2(k-1) x\n$$\n\nIt satisfies $x_{1} \\geqslant(2 k-1) x+2 k(x+1)=(4 k-1) x+2 k>x$. Then we can replace the old solution by a new one which has a larger value in $x$. After a finite number of replacements, we must get a solution with $x>\\sqrt{a}$. This shows $B \\subset A$.\n\nIf (2) is satisfied for some $x>\\sqrt{a}$ and nonnegative integer $y$, by the Claim we consider another solution to (2) defined by\n\n$$\nx_{1}=|(2 k-1) x-2 k y|, \\quad y_{1}=(2 k-1) y-2(k-1) x\n$$\n\n\n\nFrom (2), we get $\\sqrt{k} y>\\sqrt{k-1} x$. This implies $k y>\\sqrt{k(k-1)} x>(k-1) x$ and hence $(2 k-1) x-2 k y<x$. On the other hand, the relation (1) implies $x>y$. Then it is clear that $(2 k-1) x-2 k y>-x$. These combine to give $x_{1}<x$, which means we have found a solution to (2) with $x$ having a smaller absolute value. After a finite number of steps, we shall obtain a solution with $0 \\leqslant x<\\sqrt{a}$. This shows $A \\subset B$.\n\nThe desired result follows from $B \\subset A$ and $A \\subset B$.",
            "It suffices to show $A \\cup B$ is a subset of $A \\cap B$. We take any $k \\in A \\cup B$, which means there exist integers $x, y$ satisfying (1). Since $a$ is not a square, it follows that $k \\neq 1$. The result follows readily once we have proved the existence of a solution $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ to (1) with $\\left|x_{1}\\right|>|x|$, and, in case of $x>\\sqrt{a}$, another solution $\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$ with $\\left|x_{2}\\right|<|x|$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume $x, y \\geqslant 0$. Let $u=x+y$ and $v=x-y$. Then $u \\geqslant v$ and (1) becomes\n\n$$\nk=\\frac{(u+v)^{2}-4 a}{4 u v}\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nThis is the same as\n\n$$\nv^{2}+(2 u-4 k u) v+u^{2}-4 a=0\n$$\n\nLet $v_{1}=4 k u-2 u-v$. Then $u+v_{1}=4 k u-u-v \\geqslant 8 u-u-v>u+v$. By Vieta's Theorem, $v_{1}$ satisfies\n\n$$\nv_{1}^{2}+(2 u-4 k u) v_{1}+u^{2}-4 a=0\n$$\n\nThis gives $k=\\frac{\\left(u+v_{1}\\right)^{2}-4 a}{4 u v_{1}}$. As $k$ is an integer, $u+v_{1}$ must be even. Therefore, $x_{1}=\\frac{u+v_{1}}{2}$ and $y_{1}=\\frac{v_{1}-u}{2}$ are integers. By reversing the process, we can see that $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ is a solution to (1), with $x_{1}=\\frac{u+v_{1}}{2}>\\frac{u+v}{2}=x \\geqslant 0$. This completes the first half of the proof.\n\nSuppose $x>\\sqrt{a}$. Then $u+v>2 \\sqrt{a}$ and (3) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\nu^{2}+(2 v-4 k v) u+v^{2}-4 a=0\n$$\n\nLet $u_{2}=4 k v-2 v-u$.

If $u_{2} \\geqslant 0$, then $v u_{2} \\leqslant u u_{2}=v^{2}-4 a<v^{2}$. This shows $u_{2}<v \\leqslant u$ and $0<u_{2}+v<u+v$. If $u_{2}<0$, then $\\left(u_{2}+v\\right)+(u+v)=4 k v>0$ and $u_{2}+v<u+v$ imply $\\left|u_{2}+v\\right|<u+v$. In any case, since $u_{2}+v$ is even from (4), we can define $x_{2}=\\frac{u_{2}+v}{2}$ and $y_{2}=\\frac{u_{2}-v}{2}$ so that (1) is satisfied with $\\left|x_{2}\\right|<x$, as desired.

We want to find a polynomial $a_{n} x^{n}+\\ldots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ satisfying the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\left(x_{1}^{n}+x_{2}^{n}\\right) a_{n}+\\left(x_{1}^{n-1}+x_{2}^{n-1}\\right) a_{n-1}+\\ldots+2 a_{0}=0 \\\\\n\\left(x_{3}^{n}+x_{4}^{n}\\right) a_{n}+\\left(x_{3}^{n-1}+x_{4}^{n-1}\\right) a_{n-1}+\\ldots+2 a_{0}=0 \\\\\n\\ldots \\\\\n\\left(x_{2 n-1}^{n}+x_{2 n}^{n}\\right) a_{n}+\\left(x_{2 n-1}^{n-1}+x_{2 n}^{n-1}\\right) a_{n-1}+\\ldots+2 a_{0}=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe use the well known fact that a homogeneous system of $n$ linear equations in $n+1$ variables has a nonzero solution. (This fact can be proved using induction on $n$, via elimination of variables.) Applying this fact to the above system, we find a nonzero polynomial $P(x)$ of degree not exceeding $n$ such that its coefficients $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ satisfy this system. Therefore $P\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)+P\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)=0$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. Notice that $P$ has a root on each segment $\\left[x_{2 i-1}, x_{2 i}\\right]$ by the Intermediate Value theorem, so $n$ roots in total. Since $P$ is nonzero, we get $\\operatorname{deg} P=n$.\n\nNow consider a polynomial $P(x)$ provided by the Claim, and take $Q(x)=-P(x)$. The properties of $P(x)$ yield that $P\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)=Q\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)$ and $Q\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)=P\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. It is also clear that $P \\neq-P=Q$ and $\\operatorname{deg} Q=\\operatorname{deg} P=n$.\n\nSo the magician cannot find a strategy to perform such a trick."

It suffices to partition $S$ into two sets, each consisting of $n$ pairs, such that each set contains two coins of each color.\n\nIntroduce a multi-graph $G$ (i.e., a graph with loops and multiple edges allowed) on $n$ vertices, so that each vertex corresponds to a color. For each pair of coins from $S$, we add an edge between the vertices corresponding to the colors of those coins. Note that each vertex has degree 4. Also, a desired partition of the coins corresponds to a coloring of the edges of $G$ in two colors, say red and blue, so that each vertex has degree 2 with respect to each color (i.e., each vertex has equal red and blue degrees).\n\nTo complete the solution, it suffices to provide such a coloring for each component $G^{\\prime}$ of $G$. Since all degrees of the vertices are even, in $G^{\\prime}$ there exists an Euler circuit $C$ (i.e., a circuit passing through each edge of $G^{\\prime}$ exactly once). Note that the number of edges in $C$ is even (it equals twice the number of vertices in $G^{\\prime}$ ). Hence all the edges can be colored red and blue so that any two edges adjacent in $C$ have different colors (one may move along $C$ and color the edges one by one alternating red and blue colors).

In each of $n$ colors of coins we can choose one of three possible matchings; this results in $3^{n}$ ways of constructing grey edges. Let us call each of $3^{n}$ possible graphs $\\Gamma$ a cyclic graph. Note that in a cyclic graph $\\Gamma$ each vertex has both black and grey degrees equal to 1 . Hence $\\Gamma$ is a union of disjoint cycles, and in each cycle black and grey edges alternate (in particular, all cycles have even lengths).\n\nIt suffices to find a cyclic graph with all its cycle lengths divisible by 4 . Indeed, in this case, for each cycle we start from some vertex, move along the cycle and recolor the black edges either to red or to blue, alternating red and blue colors.

For some color $c$ the cycle $C_{1}$ contains exactly one grey edge joining two vertices $i, j$ of color $c$, while the other edge joining two vertices $k, \\ell$ of color $c$ lies in another cycle $C_{2}$. Now delete edges $(i, j)$ and $(k, \\ell)$ and add edges $(i, k)$ and $(j, \\ell)$. By this switch we again obtain a cyclic graph $\\Gamma_{0}^{\\prime}$ and decrease the number of cycles by 1 .

This homothety takes $T_{1}$ to $T_{3}$ (since the tangents to $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{3}$ at $T_{1}$ to $T_{3}$ are parallel), hence $S$ is a point on the segment $T_{1} T_{3}$ with $T_{1} S: S T_{3}=r_{1}: r_{3}$.\n\nConstruct segments $S_{1} S_{3} \\| K L$ and $S_{2} S_{4} \\| L M$ through $S$ with $S_{1} \\in N K, S_{2} \\in K L$, $S_{3} \\in L M$, and $S_{4} \\in M N$.

Since $I_{1} S_{1} \\| I_{3} S_{3}$, the points $I_{1}, S_{1}, I_{3}^{\\prime}$ are collinear.

Since the lines $E O_{14}^{-}$and $\\mathrm{FO}_{34}^{-}$are distinct, both points coincide with the meeting point of those lines.\n<img_3961>\n\n\n\nTurning back to the problem, let $A B$ intersect $C D$ at $E$ and let $B C$ intersect $D A$ at $F$. Assume, without loss of generality, that $B$ lies on segments $A E$ and $C F$. We will show that the points $E$ and $F$, and the circles $\\omega_{i}$ satisfy the conditions of Lemma 2, so the problem statement follows. In the sequel, we use the notation of $O_{i j}^{ \\pm}$from the statement of Lemma 2, applied to circles $\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\omega_{3}$, and $\\omega_{4}$.\n\nUsing the relations $\\triangle E C A \\sim \\triangle E B D, K N \\| B D$, and $M N \\| A C$. we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{A N}{N D}=\\frac{A N}{A D} \\cdot \\frac{A D}{N D}=\\frac{K N}{B D} \\cdot \\frac{A C}{N M}=\\frac{A C}{B D}=\\frac{A E}{E D}\n$$\n\nTherefore, by the angle bisector theorem, point $N$ lies on the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A E D$. We prove similarly that $L$ also lies on that bisector, and that the points $K$ and $M$ lie on the internal angle bisector of $\\angle A F B$.\n\nSince $K L M N$ is a rhombus, points $K$ and $M$ are symmetric in line $E L N$. Hence, the convex quadrilateral determined by the lines $E K, E M, K L$, and $M L$ is a kite, and therefore it has an incircle $\\omega_{0}$. Applying Monge's theorem to $\\omega_{0}, \\omega_{2}$, and $\\omega_{3}$, we get that $O_{23}^{+}$lies on $K M$. On the other hand, $O_{23}^{+}$lies on $B C$, as $B C$ is an external common tangent to $\\omega_{2}$ and $\\omega_{3}$. It follows that $F=O_{23}^{+}$. Similarly, $E=O_{12}^{+}=O_{34}^{+}$, and $F=O_{41}^{+}$."

            "We prove that for each prime $p>3$ dividing a number of the form $x^{2}-x+1$ with integer $x$ there are two unconnected islands in $p$-Landia.\n\nFor brevity's sake, when a bridge connects the islands numbered $m$ and $n$, we shall speak simply that it connects $m$ and $n$.\n\nA bridge connects $m$ and $n$ if $n \\equiv m^{2}+1(\\bmod p)$ or $m \\equiv n^{2}+1(\\bmod p)$. If $m^{2}+1 \\equiv n$ $(\\bmod p)$, we draw an arrow starting at $m$ on the bridge connecting $m$ and $n$. Clearly only one arrow starts at $m$ if $m^{2}+1 \\not \\equiv m(\\bmod p)$, and no arrows otherwise. The total number of bridges does not exceed the total number of arrows.\n\nSuppose $x^{2}-x+1 \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$. We may assume that $1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant p$; then there is no arrow starting at $x$. Since $(1-x)^{2}-(1-x)+1=x^{2}-x+1,(p+1-x)^{2}+1 \\equiv(p+1-x)(\\bmod p)$, and there is also no arrow starting at $p+1-x$. If $x=p+1-x$, that is, $x=\\frac{p+1}{2}$, then $4\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)=p^{2}+3$ and therefore $x^{2}-x+1$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus the islands $x$ and $p+1-x$ are different, and no arrows start at either of them. It follows that the total number of bridges in $p$-Landia does not exceed $p-2$.\n\nLet $1,2, \\ldots, p$ be the vertices of a graph $G_{p}$, where an edge connects $m$ and $n$ if and only if there is a bridge between $m$ and $n$. The number of vertices of $G_{p}$ is $p$ and the number of edges is less than $p-1$. This means that the graph is not connected, which means that there are two islands not connected by a chain of bridges.\n\nIt remains to prove that there are infinitely many primes $p$ dividing $x^{2}-x+1$ for some integer $x$. Let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ be any finite set of such primes. The number $\\left(p_{1} p_{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}\\right)^{2}-p_{1} p_{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}+1$ is greater than 1 and not divisible by any $p_{i}$; therefore it has another prime divisor with the required property.",
            "One can show, by using only arithmetical methods, that for infinitely many $p$, the kingdom of $p$-Ladia contains two islands connected to no other island, except for each other.\n\nLet arrows between islands have the same meaning as in the previous solution. Suppose that positive $a<p$ satisfies the congruence $x^{2}-x+1 \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$. We have seen in the first solution that $b=p+1-a$ satisfies it too, and $b \\neq a$ when $p>3$. It follows that $a b \\equiv a(1-a) \\equiv 1$ $(\\bmod p)$. If an arrow goes from $t$ to $a$, then $t$ must satisfy the congruence $t^{2}+1 \\equiv a \\equiv a^{2}+1$ $(\\bmod p)$; the only such $t \\neq a$ is $p-a$. Similarly, the only arrow going to $b$ goes from $p-b$. If one of the numbers $p-a$ and $p-b$, say, $p-a$, is not at the end of any arrow, the pair $a, p-a$ is not connected with the rest of the islands. This is true if at least one of the congruences $x^{2}+1 \\equiv-a, x^{2}+1 \\equiv-b$ has no solutions, that is, either $-a-1$ or $-b-1$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.\n\nNote that $x^{2}-x+1 \\equiv x^{2}-(a+b) x+a b \\equiv(x-a)(x-b)(\\bmod p)$. Substituting $x=-1$ we get $(-1-a)(-1-b) \\equiv 3(\\bmod p)$. If 3 is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$, so is one of the numbers $-1-a$ and $-1-b$.\n\nThus it is enough to find infinitely many primes $p>3$ dividing $x^{2}-x+1$ for some integer $x$ and such that 3 is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.\n\nIf $x^{2}-x+1 \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$ then $(2 x-1)^{2} \\equiv-3(\\bmod p)$, that is, -3 is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, so 3 is a quadratic non-residue if and only if -1 is also a non-residue, in other words, $p \\equiv-1(\\bmod 4)$.\n\nSimilarly to the first solution, let $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ be primes congruent to -1 modulo 4 and dividing numbers of the form $x^{2}-x+1$. The number $\\left(2 p_{1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}\\right)^{2}-2 p_{1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}+1$ is\n\n\n\nnot divisible by any $p_{i}$ and is congruent to -1 modulo 4 , therefore, it has some prime divisor $p \\equiv-1(\\bmod 4)$ which has the required properties."

Say that the ordering $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ of $\\mathcal{S}$ is nice if it satisfies the required property.\n\nWe proceed by induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is trivial, as there are no restrictions on the ordering.\n\nTo perform the step of induction, suppose that $n \\geqslant 3$. Let $a=\\max \\mathcal{S}$, and set $\\mathcal{T}=\\mathcal{S} \\backslash\\{a\\}$. Use the inductive hypothesis to find a nice ordering $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n-1}$ of $\\mathcal{T}$.

In other words, we will show that there exists a $j \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the ordering\n\n$$\nN_{j}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{j-1}, a, b_{j}, b_{j+1}, \\ldots, b_{n-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis nice.\n\nAssume that, for some $j$, the ordering $N_{j}$ is not nice, so that some element $x$ in it divides either the sum or the difference of two adjacent ones. This did not happen in the ordering of $\\mathcal{T}$, hence $x \\in\\left\\{b_{j-1}, a, b_{j}\\right\\}$ (if, say, $b_{j-1}$ does not exist, then $x \\in\\left\\{a, b_{j}\\right\\}$; a similar agreement is applied hereafter). But the case $x=a$ is impossible: $a$ cannot divide $b_{j-1}-b_{j}$, since $0<\\left|b_{j-1}-b_{j}\\right|<a$, while $a \\nmid b_{j-1}+b_{j}$ by Observation A. Therefore $x \\in\\left\\{b_{j-1}, b_{j}\\right\\}$. In this case, assign the number $x$ to the index $j$.\n\nSuppose now that none of the $N_{j}$ is nice. Since there are $n$ possible indices $j$, and only $n-1$ elements in $\\mathcal{T}$, one of those elements (say, $b_{k}$ ) is assigned to two different indices, which then should equal $k$ and $k+1$.

Hence, if $b \\mid a+c$ for some $a, b, c \\in \\mathcal{S}$ with $a<b<c$, then $a=f(b, c)$. Therefore, the Claim is a consequence of the following combinatorial lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a set of $n \\geqslant 3$ positive integers, and let $f$ be a function which assigns to any $a, b \\in \\mathcal{S}$ with $a<b$ some integer from the range $\\{1, \\ldots, a\\}$.

We call an ordering of $\\mathcal{S}$ satisfying (i) and (ii) $f$-nice. We agree that $f(x, y)=x$ for $x \\geqslant y$; this agreement puts no extra restriction.\n\nWe proceed by induction; for the base case $n=3$, it suffices to put the maximal element in $\\mathcal{S}$ onto the middle position.\n\nTo perform the step of induction, let $p<q$ be the two minimal elements of $\\mathcal{S}$, and set $\\mathcal{T}=\\mathcal{S} \\backslash\\{p\\}$. Define a function $g$ by assigning to any elements $a<b$ of $\\mathcal{T}$ the value\n\n$$\ng(a, b)= \\begin{cases}q, & \\text { if } f(a, b)=p \\\\ f(a, b), & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nNotice that $g(a, b) \\leqslant a$ for all $a, b \\in \\mathcal{T}$.\n\nUse the inductive hypothesis to get a $g$-nice ordering $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n-1}$ of $\\mathcal{T}$. By unimodality, either $b_{1}$ or $b_{n-1}$ equals $q$; these cases differ only by reverting the order, so we assume $b_{1}=q$.\n\nNotice that, according to (1), the number $f\\left(b_{2}, b_{3}\\right)$ differs from both $p$ and $q$. On the other hand, the number $f\\left(b_{n-1}, b_{n-2}\\right)$ differs from at least one of them - say, from $r$; set $s=p+q-r$, so that $\\{r, s\\}=\\{p, q\\}$.

            "In the first two steps, we deal with any polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ satisfying $P(x, y, z)=$ $P(x, y, x y-z)$. Call such a polynomial weakly symmetric, and call a polynomial satisfying the full conditions in the problem symmetric.\n\nStep 1. We start with the description of weakly symmetric polynomials. We claim that they are exactly the polynomials in $x, y$, and $z(x y-z)$. Clearly, all such polynomials are weakly symmetric. For the converse statement, consider $P_{1}(x, y, z):=P\\left(x, y, z+\\frac{1}{2} x y\\right)$, which satisfies $P_{1}(x, y, z)=P_{1}(x, y,-z)$ and is therefore a polynomial in $x, y$, and $z^{2}$. This means that $P$ is a polynomial in $x, y$, and $\\left(z-\\frac{1}{2} x y\\right)^{2}=-z(x y-z)+\\frac{1}{4} x^{2} y^{2}$, and therefore a polynomial in $x, y$, and $z(x y-z)$.\n\nStep 2. Suppose that $P$ is weakly symmetric. Consider the monomials in $P(x, y, z)$ of highest total degree. Our aim is to show that in each such monomial $\\mu x^{a} y^{b} z^{c}$ we have $a, b \\geqslant c$. Consider the expansion\n\n$$\nP(x, y, z)=\\sum_{i, j, k} \\mu_{i j k} x^{i} y^{j}(z(x y-z))^{k}\n\\tag{1.1}\n$$\n\nThe maximal total degree of a summand in (1.1) is $m=\\max _{i, j, k: \\mu_{i j k} \\neq 0}(i+j+3 k)$. Now, for any $i, j, k$ satisfying $i+j+3 k=m$ the summand $\\mu_{i, j, k} x^{i} y^{j}(z(x y-z))^{k}$ has leading term of the form $\\mu x^{i+k} y^{j+k} z^{k}$. No other nonzero summand in (1.1) may have a term of this form in its expansion, hence this term does not cancel in the whole sum. Therefore, $\\operatorname{deg} P=m$, and the leading component of $P$ is exactly\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i+j+3 k=m} \\mu_{i, j, k} x^{i+k} y^{j+k} z^{k}\n$$\n\nand each summand in this sum satisfies the condition claimed above.\n\nStep 3. We now prove the problem statement by induction on $m=\\operatorname{deg} P$. For $m=0$ the claim is trivial. Consider now a symmetric polynomial $P$ with $\\operatorname{deg} P>0$. By Step 2, each of its monomials $\\mu x^{a} y^{b} z^{c}$ of the highest total degree satisfies $a, b \\geqslant c$. Applying other weak symmetries, we obtain $a, c \\geqslant b$ and $b, c \\geqslant a$; therefore, $P$ has a unique leading monomial of the form $\\mu(x y z)^{c}$. The polynomial $P_{0}(x, y, z)=P(x, y, z)-\\mu\\left(x y z-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}\\right)^{c}$ has smaller total degree. Since $P_{0}$ is symmetric, it is representable as a polynomial function of $x y z-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}$. Then $P$ is also of this form, completing the inductive step.",

The polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ is constant on the surface\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{S}=\\{(2 \\cos u, 2 \\cos v, 2 \\cos w): u+v+w=0\\}\n$$\n\nProof. Notice that for $x=2 \\cos u, y=2 \\cos v, z=2 \\cos w$, the Vieta jumps $x \\mapsto y z-x$, $y \\mapsto z x-y, z \\mapsto x y-z$ in $(*)$ replace $(u, v, w)$ by $(v-w,-v, w),(u, w-u,-w)$ and $(-u, v, u-v)$, respectively. For example, for the first type of jump we have\n\n$$\ny z-x=4 \\cos v \\cos w-2 \\cos u=2 \\cos (v+w)+2 \\cos (v-w)-2 \\cos u=2 \\cos (v-w) \\text {. }\n$$\n\nDefine $G(u, v, w)=P(2 \\cos u, 2 \\cos v, 2 \\cos w)$. For $u+v+w=0$, the jumps give\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nG(u, v, w) & =G(v-w,-v, w)=G(w-v,-v,(v-w)-(-v))=G(-u-2 v,-v, 2 v-w) \\\\\n& =G(u+2 v, v, w-2 v)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy induction,\n\n$$\nG(u, v, w)=G(u+2 k v, v, w-2 k v) \\quad(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}) .\n\\tag{2.2}\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\nG(u, v, w)=G(u, v-2 \\ell u, w+2 \\ell u) \\quad(\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z})\n\\tag{2.3}\n$$\n\nAnd, of course, we have\n\n$$\nG(u, v, w)=G(u+2 p \\pi, v+2 q \\pi, w-2(p+q) \\pi) \\quad(p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}) .\n\\tag{2.4}\n$$\n\nTake two nonzero real numbers $u, v$ such that $u, v$ and $\\pi$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By combining $(2.2-2.4)$, we can see that $G$ is constant on a dense subset of the plane $u+v+w=0$. By continuity, $G$ is constant on the entire plane and therefore $P$ is constant on $\\mathfrak{S}$.\n\nClaim 2. The polynomial $T(x, y, z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-x y z-4$ divides $P(x, y, z)-P(2,2,2)$. Proof. By dividing $P$ by $T$ with remainders, there exist some polynomials $R(x, y, z), A(y, z)$ and $B(y, z)$ such that\n\n$$\nP(x, y, z)-P(2,2,2)=T(x, y, z) \\cdot R(x, y, z)+A(y, z) x+B(y, z)\n\\tag{2.5}\n$$\n\nOn the surface $\\mathfrak{S}$ the LHS of $(2.5)$ is zero by Claim 1 (since $(2,2,2) \\in \\mathfrak{S}$ ) and $T=0$ by (2.1). Hence, $A(y, z) x+B(y, z)$ vanishes on $\\mathfrak{S}$.\n\nNotice that for every $y=2 \\cos v$ and $z=2 \\cos w$ with $\\frac{\\pi}{3}<v, w<\\frac{2 \\pi}{3}$, there are two distinct values of $x$ such that $(x, y, z) \\in \\mathfrak{S}$, namely $x_{1}=2 \\cos (v+w)$ (which is negative), and $x_{2}=2 \\cos (v-w)$ (which is positive). This can happen only if $A(y, z)=B(y, z)=0$. Hence, $A(y, z)=B(y, z)=0$ for $|y|<1,|z|<1$. The polynomials $A$ and $B$ vanish on an open set, so $A$ and $B$ are both the zero polynomial.\n\n\n\nThe quotient $(P(x, y, z)-P(2,2,2)) / T(x, y, z)$ is a polynomial of lower degree than $P$ and it also satisfies $(*)$. The problem statement can now be proven by induction on the degree of $P$.",
            "Let $Q=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-x y z$ and let $t \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Checking where $Q-t, \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial z}$ vanish simultaneously, we find that the surface $Q=t$ is smooth except for the cases $t=0$, when the only singular point is $(0,0,0)$, and $t=4$, when the four points $( \\pm 2, \\pm 2, \\pm 2)$ that satisfy $x y z=8$ are the only singular points. The singular points are the fixed points of the group $\\Gamma$ of polynomial automorphisms of $\\mathbb{C}^{3}$ generated by the three Vieta involutions\n\n$$\n\\iota_{1}:(x, y, z) \\mapsto(x, y, x y-z), \\quad \\iota_{2}:(x, y, z) \\mapsto(x, x z-y, z), \\quad \\iota_{3}:(x, y, z) \\mapsto(y z-x, y, z)\n$$\n\n$\\Gamma$ acts on each surface $\\mathcal{V}_{t}: Q-t=0$. If $Q-t$ were reducible then the surface $Q=t$ would contain a curve of singular points. Therefore $Q-t$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]$. (One can also prove algebraically that $Q-t$ is irreducible, for example by checking that its discriminant as a quadratic polynomial in $x$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{C}[y, z]$, and likewise for the other two variables.) In the following solution we will only use the algebraic surface $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$.\n\nLet $U$ be the $\\Gamma$-orbit of $(3,3,3)$. Consider $\\iota_{3} \\circ \\iota_{2}$, which leaves $z$ invariant. For each fixed value of $z, \\iota_{3} \\circ \\iota_{2}$ acts linearly on $(x, y)$ by the matrix\n\n$$\nM_{z}:=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nz^{2}-1 & -z \\\\\nz & -1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe reverse composition $\\iota_{2} \\circ \\iota_{3}$ acts by $M_{z}^{-1}=M_{z}^{a d j}$. Note $\\operatorname{det} M_{z}=1$ and $\\operatorname{tr} M_{z}=z^{2}-2$. When $z$ does not lie in the real interval $[-2,2]$, the eigenvalues of $M_{z}$ do not have absolute value 1 , so every orbit of the group generated by $M_{z}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$ is unbounded. For example, fixing $z=3$ we find $\\left(3 F_{2 k+1}, 3 F_{2 k-1}, 3\\right) \\in U$ for every $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\left(F_{n}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is the Fibonacci sequence with $F_{0}=0, F_{1}=1$.\n\nNow we may start at any point $\\left(3 F_{2 k+1}, 3 F_{2 k-1}, 3\\right)$ and iteratively apply $\\iota_{1} \\circ \\iota_{2}$ to generate another infinite sequence of distinct points of $U$, Zariski dense in the hyperbola cut out of $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$ by the plane $x-3 F_{2 k+1}=0$. (The plane $x=a$ cuts out an irreducible conic when $a \\notin\\{-2,0,2\\}$.) Thus the Zariski closure $\\bar{U}$ of $U$ contains infinitely many distinct algebraic curves in $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$. Since $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$ is an irreducible surface this implies that $\\bar{U}=\\mathcal{V}_{0}$.\n\nFor any polynomial $P$ satisfying $(*)$, we have $P-P(3,3,3)=0$ at each point of $U$. Since $\\bar{U}=\\mathcal{V}_{0}, P-P(3,3,3)$ vanishes on $\\mathcal{V}_{0}$. Then Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the irreducibility of $Q$ imply that $P-P(3,3,3)$ is divisible by $Q$. Now $(P-P(3,3,3)) / Q$ is a polynomial also satisfying $(*)$, so we may complete the proof by an induction on the total degree, as in the other solutions.\n\n### 分析\nThe polynomial $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-x y z$ satisfies the condition $(*)$, so every polynomial of the form $F\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-x y z\\right)$ does satisfy $(*)$. We will use without comment the fact that two polynomials have the same coefficients if and only if they are equal as functions."

            "The problem has an obvious rephrasing in terms of graph theory. One is given a graph $G$ with 2019 vertices, 1010 of which have degree 1009 and 1009 of which have degree 1010.

Then one may remove the edges $A B$ and $A C$ from $G$ and add the edge $B C$ into $G$.\n\nCall such an operation a refriending. One wants to prove that, via a sequence of such refriendings, one can reach a graph which is a disjoint union of single edges and vertices.\n\n\nNote that the given graph is connected, since the total degree of any two vertices is at least 2018 and hence they are either adjacent or have at least one neighbour in common. Hence the given graph satisfies the following condition:\n$$\n\\text{Every connected component of $G$ with at least three vertices is not complete and has a vertex of odd degree.}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nWe will show that if a graph $G$ satisfies condition (1) and has a vertex of degree at least 2 , then there is a refriending on $G$ that preserves condition (1). Since refriendings decrease the total number of edges of $G$, by using a sequence of such refriendings, we must reach a graph $G$ with maximal degree at most 1 , so we are done.\n\n<img_3653>\n\n\n\nPick a vertex $A$ of degree at least 2 in a connected component $G^{\\prime}$ of $G$. Since no component of $G$ with at least three vertices is complete we may assume that not all of the neighbours of $A$ are adjacent to one another. (For example, pick a maximal complete subgraph $K$ of $G^{\\prime}$. Some vertex $A$ of $K$ has a neighbour outside $K$, and this neighbour is not adjacent to every vertex of $K$ by maximality.) Removing $A$ from $G$ splits $G^{\\prime}$ into smaller connected components $G_{1}, \\ldots, G_{k}$ (possibly with $k=1$ ), to each of which $A$ is connected by at least one edge. We divide into several cases.\n\nCase 1: $k \\geqslant 2$ and $A$ is connected to some $G_{i}$ by at least two edges.\n\nChoose a vertex $B$ of $G_{i}$ adjacent to $A$, and a vertex $C$ in another component $G_{j}$ adjacent to $A$. The vertices $B$ and $C$ are not adjacent, and hence removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ does not disconnect $G^{\\prime}$. It is easy to see that this preserves the condition, since the refriending does not change the parity of the degrees of vertices.\n\nCase 2: $k \\geqslant 2$ and $A$ is connected to each $G_{i}$ by exactly one edge.\n\nConsider the induced subgraph on any $G_{i}$ and the vertex $A$. The vertex $A$ has degree 1 in this subgraph; since the number of odd-degree vertices of a graph is always even, we see that $G_{i}$ has a vertex of odd degree (in $G$ ). Thus if we let $B$ and $C$ be any distinct neighbours of $A$, then removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ preserves the above condition: the refriending creates two new components, and if either of these components has at least three vertices, then it cannot be complete and must contain a vertex of odd degree (since each $G_{i}$ does).\n\nCase 3: $k=1$ and $A$ is connected to $G_{1}$ by at least three edges.\n\nBy assumption, $A$ has two neighbours $B$ and $C$ which are not adjacent to one another. Removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ does not disconnect $G^{\\prime}$. We are then done as in Case 1.\n\nCase 4: $k=1$ and $A$ is connected to $G_{1}$ by exactly two edges.\n\nLet $B$ and $C$ be the two neighbours of $A$, which are not adjacent. Removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ results in two new components: one consisting of a single vertex; and the other containing a vertex of odd degree. We are done unless this second component would be a complete graph on at least 3 vertices. But in this case, $G_{1}$ would be a complete graph minus the single edge $B C$, and hence has at least 4 vertices since $G^{\\prime}$ is not a 4-cycle. If we let $D$ be a third vertex of $G_{1}$, then removing edges $B A$ and $B D$ and adding in edge $A D$ does not disconnect $G^{\\prime}$. We are then done as in Case 1.\n\n<img_3501>",

One wants to prove that, via a sequence of such refriendings, one can reach a graph which is a disjoint union of single edges and vertices.\n\n\nnote that a refriending preserves the property that a graph has a vertex of odd degree and (trivially) the property that it is not complete; note also that our initial graph is connected. We describe an algorithm to reduce our initial graph to a graph of maximal degree at most 1 , proceeding in two steps.\n\nStep 1: There exists a sequence of refriendings reducing the graph to a tree.\n\nProof. Since the number of edges decreases with each refriending, it suffices to prove the following: as long as the graph contains a cycle, there exists a refriending such that the resulting graph is still connected. We will show that the graph in fact contains a cycle $Z$ and vertices $A, B, C$ such that $A$ and $B$ are adjacent in the cycle $Z, C$ is not in $Z$, and is adjacent to $A$ but not $B$. Removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ keeps the graph connected, so we are done.\n\n<img_3186>\n\nTo find this cycle $Z$ and vertices $A, B, C$, we pursue one of two strategies. If the graph contains a triangle, we consider a largest complete subgraph $K$, which thus contains at least three vertices. Since the graph itself is not complete, there is a vertex $C$ not in $K$ connected to a vertex $A$ of $K$. By maximality of $K$, there is a vertex $B$ of $K$ not connected to $C$, and hence we are done by choosing a cycle $Z$ in $K$ through the edge $A B$.\n\n<img_3196>\n\nIf the graph is triangle-free, we consider instead a smallest cycle $Z$. This cycle cannot be Hamiltonian (i.e. it cannot pass through every vertex of the graph), since otherwise by minimality the graph would then have no other edges, and hence would have even degree at every vertex. We may thus choose a vertex $C$ not in $Z$ adjacent to a vertex $A$ of $Z$. Since the graph is triangle-free, it is not adjacent to any neighbour $B$ of $A$ in $Z$, and we are done.\n\nStep 2: Any tree may be reduced to a disjoint union of single edges and vertices by a sequence of refriendings.\n\nProof. The refriending preserves the property of being acyclic. Hence, after applying a sequence of refriendings, we arrive at an acyclic graph in which it is impossible to perform any further refriendings. The maximal degree of any such graph is 1: if it had a vertex $A$ with two neighbours $B, C$, then $B$ and $C$ would necessarily be nonadjacent since the graph is cycle-free, and so a refriending would be possible. Thus we reach a graph with maximal degree at most 1 as desired."

Then $S=\\sum_{i \\in L} \\phi_{i}-\\sum_{i \\in R} \\phi_{i}=(180(|L|-|R|)-360 k)^{\\circ}$, which is a multiple of $360^{\\circ}$ since the number of points is even. We will show that the points can be labelled such that $S=0$, in which case $L$ and $R$ satisfy the required condition of the problem.\n\nNote that the value of $S$ is defined for a slightly larger class of configurations: it is OK for two points to coincide, as long as they are not consecutive, and OK for three points to be collinear, as long as $A_{i}, A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+2}$ do not appear on a line in that order. In what follows it will be convenient, although not strictly necessary, to consider such configurations.\n\nConsider how $S$ changes if a single one of the $A_{i}$ is moved along some straight-line path (not passing through any $A_{j}$ and not lying on any line $A_{j} A_{k}$, but possibly crossing such lines). Because $S$ is a multiple of $360^{\\circ}$, and the angles change continuously, $S$ can only change when a point moves between $R$ and $L$. Furthermore, if $\\phi_{j}=0$ when $A_{j}$ moves between $R$ and $L, S$ is unchanged; it only changes if $\\phi_{j}=180^{\\circ}$ when $A_{j}$ moves between those sets.\n\nFor any starting choice of points, we will now construct a new configuration, with labels such that $S=0$, that can be perturbed into the original one without any $\\phi_{i}$ passing through $180^{\\circ}$, so that $S=0$ for the original configuration with those labels as well.\n\nTake some line such that there are $n$ points on each side of that line. The new configuration has $n$ copies of a single point on each side of the line, and a path that alternates between\n\n\n\nsides of the line; all angles are 0 , so this configuration has $S=0$. Perturbing the points into their original positions, while keeping each point on its side of the line, no angle $\\phi_{i}$ can pass through $180^{\\circ}$, because no straight line can go from one side of the line to the other and back. So the perturbation process leaves $S=0$.",
            "First, let $\\ell$ be a line in the plane such that there are $n$ points on one side and the other $n$ points on the other side. For convenience, assume $\\ell$ is horizontal (otherwise, we can rotate the plane). Then we can use the terms \"above\", \"below\", \"left\" and \"right\" in the usual way. We denote the $n$ points above the line in an arbitrary order as $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}$, and the $n$ points below the line as $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, \\ldots, Q_{n}$.\n\nIf we connect $P_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ with a line segment, the line segment will intersect with the line $\\ell$. Denote the intersection as $I_{i j}$. If $P_{i}$ is connected to $Q_{j}$ and $Q_{k}$, where $j<k$, then $I_{i j}$ and $I_{i k}$ are two different points, because $P_{i}, Q_{j}$ and $Q_{k}$ are not collinear.\n\nNow we define a \"sign\" for each angle $\\angle Q_{j} P_{i} Q_{k}$. Assume $j<k$. We specify that the sign is positive for the following two cases:\n\n- if $i$ is odd and $I_{i j}$ is to the left of $I_{i k}$,\n- if $i$ is even and $I_{i j}$ is to the right of $I_{i k}$.\n\nOtherwise the sign of the angle is negative. If $j>k$, then the sign of $\\angle Q_{j} P_{i} Q_{k}$ is taken to be the same as for $\\angle Q_{k} P_{i} Q_{j}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can define the sign of $\\angle P_{j} Q_{i} P_{k}$ with $j<k$ (or equivalently $\\angle P_{k} Q_{i} P_{j}$ ). For example, it is positive when $i$ is odd and $I_{j i}$ is to the left of $I_{k i}$.\n\nHenceforth, whenever we use the notation $\\angle Q_{j} P_{i} Q_{k}$ or $\\angle P_{j} Q_{i} P_{k}$ for a numerical quantity, it is understood to denote either the (geometric) measure of the angle or the negative of this measure, depending on the sign as specified above.\n\nWe now have the following important fact for signed angle measures:\n\n$$\n\\angle Q_{i_{1}} P_{k} Q_{i_{3}}=\\angle Q_{i_{1}} P_{k} Q_{i_{2}}+\\angle Q_{i_{2}} P_{k} Q_{i_{3}}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor all points $P_{k}, Q_{i_{1}}, Q_{i_{2}}$ and $Q_{i_{3}}$ with $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}$. The following figure shows a \"natural\" arrangement of the points. Equation (1) still holds for any other arrangement, as can be easily verified.\n\n<img_3761>\n\nSimilarly, we have\n\n$$\n\\angle P_{i_{1}} Q_{k} P_{i_{3}}=\\angle P_{i_{1}} Q_{k} P_{i_{2}}+\\angle P_{i_{2}} Q_{k} P_{i_{3}},\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nfor all points $Q_{k}, P_{i_{1}}, P_{i_{2}}$ and $P_{i_{3}}$, with $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}$.\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to specify the desired ordering $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ of the points:\n\n- if $i \\leqslant n$ is odd, put $A_{i}=P_{i}$ and $A_{2 n+1-i}=Q_{i}$;\n- if $i \\leqslant n$ is even, put $A_{i}=Q_{i}$ and $A_{2 n+1-i}=P_{i}$.\n\nFor example, for $n=3$ this ordering is $P_{1}, Q_{2}, P_{3}, Q_{3}, P_{2}, Q_{1}$. This sequence alternates between $P$ 's and $Q$ 's, so the above conventions specify a sign for each of the angles $A_{i-1} A_{i} A_{i+1}$. We claim that the sum of these $2 n$ signed angles equals 0 . If we can show this, it would complete the proof.\n\nWe prove the claim by induction. For brevity, we use the notation $\\angle P_{i}$ to denote whichever of the $2 n$ angles has its vertex at $P_{i}$, and $\\angle Q_{i}$ similarly.\n\nFirst let $n=2$. If the four points can be arranged to form a convex quadrilateral, then the four line segments $P_{1} Q_{1}, P_{1} Q_{2}, P_{2} Q_{1}$ and $P_{2} Q_{2}$ constitute a self-intersecting quadrilateral. We use several figures to illustrate the possible cases.\n\nThe following figure is one possible arrangement of the points.\n\n<img_3241>\n\nThen $\\angle P_{1}$ and $\\angle Q_{1}$ are positive, $\\angle P_{2}$ and $\\angle Q_{2}$ are negative, and we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\angle P_{1}\\right|+\\left|\\angle Q_{1}\\right|=\\left|\\angle P_{2}\\right|+\\left|\\angle Q_{2}\\right| .\n$$\n\nWith signed measures, we have\n\n$$\n\\angle P_{1}+\\angle Q_{1}+\\angle P_{2}+\\angle Q_{2}=0\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nIf we switch the labels of $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, we have the following picture:\n\n<img_3724>\n\nSwitching labels $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ has the effect of flipping the sign of all four angles (as well as swapping the magnitudes on the relabelled points); that is, the new values of $\\left(\\angle P_{1}, \\angle P_{2}, \\angle Q_{1}, \\angle Q_{2}\\right.$ ) equal the old values of $\\left(-\\angle P_{2},-\\angle P_{1},-\\angle Q_{1},-\\angle Q_{2}\\right)$. Consequently, equation (3) still holds. Similarly, when switching the labels of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, or both the $P$ 's and the $Q$ 's, equation (3) still holds.\n\n\n\nThe remaining subcase of $n=2$ is that one point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three. We have the following picture.\n\n<img_3780>\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\angle P_{1}\\right|+\\left|\\angle Q_{1}\\right|+\\left|\\angle Q_{2}\\right|=\\left|\\angle P_{2}\\right|\n$$\n\nand equation (3) holds.\n\nAgain, switching the labels for $P$ 's or the $Q$ 's will not affect the validity of equation (3). Also, if the point lying inside the triangle of the other three is one of the $Q$ 's rather than the $P$ 's, the result still holds, since our sign convention is preserved when we relabel $Q$ 's as $P$ 's and vice-versa and reflect across $\\ell$.\n\nWe have completed the proof of the claim for $n=2$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n=k$, and we wish to prove it for $n=k+1$. Suppose we are given our $2(k+1)$ points. First ignore $P_{k+1}$ and $Q_{k+1}$, and form $2 k$ angles from $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{k}$, $Q_{1}, \\ldots, Q_{k}$ as in the $n=k$ case. By the induction hypothesis we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\angle P_{i}+\\angle Q_{i}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nWhen we add in the two points $P_{k+1}$ and $Q_{k+1}$, this changes our angles as follows:\n\n- the angle at $P_{k}$ changes from $\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k}$ to $\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k+1}$;\n- the angle at $Q_{k}$ changes from $\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k}$ to $\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k+1}$;\n- two new angles $\\angle Q_{k} P_{k+1} Q_{k+1}$ and $\\angle P_{k} Q_{k+1} P_{k+1}$ are added.\n\nWe need to prove the changes have no impact on the total sum. In other words, we need to prove\n\n$$\n\\left(\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k+1}-\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k}\\right)+\\left(\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k+1}-\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k}\\right)+\\left(\\angle P_{k+1}+\\angle Q_{k+1}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nIn fact, from equations (1) and (2), we have\n\n$$\n\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k+1}-\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k}=\\angle Q_{k} P_{k} Q_{k+1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k+1}-\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k}=\\angle P_{k} Q_{k} P_{k+1} .\n$$\n\nTherefore, the left hand side of equation (4) becomes $\\angle Q_{k} P_{k} Q_{k+1}+\\angle P_{k} Q_{k} P_{k+1}+\\angle Q_{k} P_{k+1} Q_{k+1}+$ $\\angle P_{k} Q_{k+1} P_{k+1}$, which equals 0 , simply by applying the $n=2$ case of the claim. This completes the induction.",

So at the end of this phase, $|S|=n-k+1$, while a total of $n+k-1$ questions have been asked. Furthermore, the undirected graph of roads within $S$ whose directions are known contains no cycles (as $T$ is no longer a member of $S$, all questions asked in this phase involved $T$ and the graph was a tree before this phase started). Every town in $S$ has exactly one outgoing road known (not necessarily to another town in $S$ ).\n\nPhase 4. During this phase, Alice repeatedly picks any pair of towns in $S$ for which she does not know the direction of the road between them. Because every town in $S$ has exactly one outgoing road known, this always results in the removal of one of those two towns from $S$. Because there are no cycles in the graph of roads of known direction within $S$, this can continue until there are at most 2 towns left in $S$.\n\nIf it ends with $t$ towns left, $n-k+1-t$ questions were asked in this phase, so a total of $2 n-t$ questions have been asked.\n\nPhase 5. During this phase, Alice asks about all the roads from the remaining towns in $S$ that she has not previously asked about. She has definitely already asked about any road between those towns (if $t=2$ ). She must also have asked in one of the first two phases about\n\n\n\nat least one other road involving one of those towns (as those phases resulted in a tree with $n>2$ vertices). So she asks at most $t(n-t)-1$ questions in this phase.\n\nAt the end of this phase, Alice knows whether any town has at most one outgoing road. If $t=1$, at most $3 n-3 \\leqslant 4 n-7$ questions were needed in total, while if $t=2$, at most $4 n-7$ questions were needed in total."

This would violate the angle inequality $\\angle E D C \\neq 2 \\cdot \\angle A D B$ given in the question.\n\nNext, let $E^{\\prime}$ denote the second point of intersection of $P^{\\prime} E$ with $\\Gamma$, and let $E^{\\prime \\prime}$ denote the point on $\\Gamma$ diametrically opposite $E^{\\prime}$, so that $E^{\\prime \\prime} E$ is perpendicular to $P^{\\prime} E$. The point $G$ lies on the perpendicular bisectors of the sides $P^{\\prime} E$ and $E E^{\\prime \\prime}$ of the right-angled triangle $P^{\\prime} E E^{\\prime \\prime}$; it follows that $G$ is the midpoint of $P^{\\prime} E^{\\prime \\prime}$. Since $D$ is the midpoint of $E^{\\prime} E^{\\prime \\prime}$, we have that $G D=\\frac{1}{2} P^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}$. Since $P^{\\prime} M=\\frac{1}{2} P^{\\prime} E$, we have $G D \\cdot P^{\\prime} M=\\frac{1}{4} P^{\\prime} E^{\\prime} \\cdot P^{\\prime} E=\\frac{1}{4} h$. The other equality $H D \\cdot P^{\\prime} N$ follows by exactly the same argument.\n\n<img_3232>\n\nFrom this claim, we see that the area condition is equivalent to the equality\n\n$$\n\\left(M A: P^{\\prime} M\\right)=\\left(N B: P^{\\prime} N\\right)\n$$\n\nof ratios of signed lengths, which is equivalent to direct similarity of $A P^{\\prime} M$ and $B P^{\\prime} N$, as desired.",
            "Along the perpendicular bisector of $C E$, define the linear function\n\n$$\nf(X)=\\operatorname{area}(B C X)+\\operatorname{area}(A X E)-\\operatorname{area}(A B X)-\\operatorname{area}(A B P)\n$$\n\nwhere, from now on, we always use signed areas. Thus, we want to show that $C, P, E$ are collinear if and only if $f(D)=0$.\n\n<img_3489>\n\nLet $P^{\\prime}$ be the reflection of $P$ across line $A B$. The point $P^{\\prime}$ does not lie on the line $C E$. To see this, we let $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime \\prime}$ be the points obtained from $A$ and $B$ by dilating with scale factor 2 about $P^{\\prime}$, so that $P$ is the orthogonal projection of $P^{\\prime}$ onto $A^{\\prime \\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime}$. Since $A$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $P^{\\prime} E$, the triangle $A^{\\prime \\prime} E P^{\\prime}$ is right-angled at $E$ (and $B^{\\prime \\prime} C P^{\\prime}$ similarly). If $P^{\\prime}$ were to lie on $C E$, then the lines $A^{\\prime \\prime} E$ and $B^{\\prime \\prime} C$ would be perpendicular to $C E$ and $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime \\prime}$ would lie on the opposite side of $C E$ to $D$. It follows that the line $A^{\\prime \\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime}$ does not meet triangle $C D E$, and hence point $P$ does not lie inside $C D E$. But then $P$ must lie inside $A B C E$, and it is clear that such a point cannot reflect to a point $P^{\\prime}$ on $C E$.\n\nWe thus let $O$ be the centre of the circle $C E P^{\\prime}$. The lines $A O$ and $B O$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $E P^{\\prime}$ and $C P^{\\prime}$, respectively, so\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{area}(B C O)+\\operatorname{area}(A O E) & =\\operatorname{area}\\left(O P^{\\prime} B\\right)+\\operatorname{area}\\left(P^{\\prime} O A\\right)=\\operatorname{area}\\left(P^{\\prime} B O A\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{area}(A B O)+\\operatorname{area}\\left(B A P^{\\prime}\\right)=\\operatorname{area}(A B O)+\\operatorname{area}(A B P)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand hence $f(O)=0$.\n\nNotice that if point $O$ coincides with $D$ then points $A, B$ lie in angle domain $C D E$ and $\\angle E O C=2 \\cdot \\angle A O B$, which is not allowed. So, $O$ and $D$ must be distinct. Since $f$ is linear and vanishes at $O$, it follows that $f(D)=0$ if and only if $f$ is constant zero - we want to show this occurs if and only if $C, P, E$ are collinear.\n<img_3610>\n\nIn the one direction, suppose firstly that $C, P, E$ are not collinear, and let $T$ be the centre of the circle $C E P$. The same calculation as above provides\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{area}(B C T)+\\operatorname{area}(A T E)=\\operatorname{area}(P B T A)=\\operatorname{area}(A B T)-\\operatorname{area}(A B P)\n$$\n\n$$\nf(T)=-2 \\operatorname{area}(A B P) \\neq 0 .\n$$\n\n\n\nHence, the linear function $f$ is nonconstant with its zero is at $O$, so that $f(D) \\neq 0$.\n\nIn the other direction, suppose that the points $C, P, E$ are collinear. We will show that $f$ is constant zero by finding a second point (other than $O$ ) at which it vanishes.\n\n<img_3865>\n\nLet $Q$ be the reflection of $P$ across the midpoint of $A B$, so $P A Q B$ is a parallelogram. It is easy to see that $Q$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $C E$; for instance if $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$ are the points produced from $A$ and $B$ by dilating about $P$ with scale factor 2 , then the projection of $Q$ to $C E$ is the midpoint of the projections of $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$, which are $E$ and $C$ respectively. The triangles $B C Q$ and $A Q E$ are indirectly congruent, so\n\n$$\nf(Q)=(\\operatorname{area}(B C Q)+\\operatorname{area}(A Q E))-(\\operatorname{area}(A B Q)-\\operatorname{area}(B A P))=0-0=0\n$$\n\nThe points $O$ and $Q$ are distinct. To see this, consider the circle $\\omega$ centred on $Q$ with $P^{\\prime}$ on the circumference; since triangle $P P^{\\prime} Q$ is right-angled at $P^{\\prime}$, it follows that $P$ lies outside $\\omega$. On the other hand, $P$ lies between $C$ and $E$ on the line $C P E$. It follows that $C$ and $E$ cannot both lie on $\\omega$, so that $\\omega$ is not the circle $C E P^{\\prime}$ and $Q \\neq O$.\n\nSince $O$ and $Q$ are distinct zeroes of the linear function $f$, we have $f(D)=0$ as desired."

If $X Y$ is not $(P, \\alpha)$-good then by the previous Lemma, $f(X Y)=X$ and similarly $f(X Y)=Y$, but clearly this is impossible as $X \\neq Y$.\n\nLemma 3. If $\\ell_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ are different $(P, \\alpha)$-good lines which intersect at $X \\neq P$, then either $f\\left(\\ell_{1}\\right)=X$ or $f\\left(\\ell_{2}\\right)=X$ or $X$ is $(P, \\alpha)$-good.\n\nProof. If $f\\left(\\ell_{1}\\right), f\\left(\\ell_{2}\\right) \\neq X$, then $g(X)$ is the circumcircle of $X, f\\left(\\ell_{1}\\right)$ and $f\\left(\\ell_{2}\\right)$. Since $\\ell_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ are $(P, \\alpha)$-good lines, the angles\n\n$$\n\\angle\\left(\\operatorname{Pf}\\left(\\ell_{1}\\right), f\\left(\\ell_{1}\\right) X\\right)=\\angle\\left(\\operatorname{Pf}\\left(\\ell_{2}\\right), f\\left(\\ell_{2}\\right) X\\right)=\\alpha\n$$\n\nso $P$ lies on $g(X)$. Hence, $X$ is $(P, \\alpha)$-good.\n\nLemma 4. If $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}$ and $\\ell_{3}$ are different $(P, \\alpha)$-good lines which intersect at $X \\neq P$, then $X$ is $(P, \\alpha)$-good.\n\nProof. This follows from the previous Lemma since at most one of the three lines $\\ell_{i}$ can satisfy $f\\left(\\ell_{i}\\right)=X$ as the three lines are all $(P, \\alpha)$-good.\n\nLemma 5. If $A B C$ is a triangle such that $A, B, C, f(A B), f(A C)$ and $f(B C)$ are all different points, then there is some point $P$ and some angle $\\alpha$ such that $A, B$ and $C$ are $(P, \\alpha) \\operatorname{good}$ points and $A B, B C$ and $C A$ are $(P, \\alpha)$-good lines.\n\n\n\n<img_3508>\n\nProof. Let $D, E, F$ denote the points $f(B C), f(A C), f(A B)$, respectively. Then $g(A)$, $g(B)$ and $g(C)$ are the circumcircles of $A E F, B D F$ and $C D E$, respectively. Let $P \\neq F$ be the second intersection of circles $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ (or, if these circles are tangent at $F$, then $P=F$ ). By Miquel's theorem (or an easy angle chase), $g(C)$ also passes through $P$. Then by the cyclic quadrilaterals, the directed angles\n\n$$\n\\angle(P D, D C)=\\angle(P F, F B)=\\angle(P E, E A)=\\alpha\n$$\n\nfor some angle $\\alpha$. Hence, lines $A B, B C$ and $C A$ are all $(P, \\alpha)$-good, so by Lemma $3, A, B$ and $C$ are $(P, \\alpha)$-good. (In the case where $P=D$, the line $P D$ in the equation above denotes the line which is tangent to $g(B)$ at $P=D$. Similar definitions are used for $P E$ and $P F$ in the cases where $P=E$ or $P=F$.)\n\nConsider the set $\\Omega$ of all points $(x, y)$ with integer coordinates $1 \\leqslant x, y \\leqslant 1000$, and consider the set $L_{\\Omega}$ of all horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines passing through at least one point in $\\Omega$. A simple counting argument shows that there are 5998 lines in $L_{\\Omega}$. For each line $\\ell$ in $L_{\\Omega}$ we colour the point $f(\\ell)$ red. Then there are at most 5998 red points. Now we partition the points in $\\Omega$ into 10000 ten by ten squares. Since there are at most 5998 red points, at least one of these squares $\\Omega_{10}$ contains no red points. Let $(m, n)$ be the bottom left point in $\\Omega_{10}$. Then the triangle with vertices $(m, n),(m+1, n)$ and $(m, n+1)$ satisfies the condition of Lemma 5 , so these three vertices are all $(P, \\alpha)$-good for some point $P$ and angle $\\alpha$, as are the lines joining them. From this point on, we will simply call a point or line good if it is $(P, \\alpha)$-good for this particular pair $(P, \\alpha)$. Now by Lemma 1 , the line $x=m+1$ is good, as is the line $y=n+1$. Then Lemma 3 implies that $(m+1, n+1)$ is good. By applying these two lemmas repeatedly, we can prove that the line $x+y=m+n+2$ is good, then the points $(m, n+2)$ and $(m+2, n)$ then the lines $x=m+2$ and $y=n+2$, then the points $(m+2, n+1),(m+1, n+2)$ and $(m+2, n+2)$ and so on until we have prove that all points in $\\Omega_{10}$ are good.\n\nNow we will use this to prove that every point $S \\neq P$ is good. Since $g(S)$ is a circle, it passes through at most two points of $\\Omega_{10}$ on any vertical line, so at most 20 points in total. Moreover, any line $\\ell$ through $S$ intersects at most 10 points in $\\Omega_{10}$. Hence, there are at least eight lines $\\ell$ through $S$ which contain a point $Q$ in $\\Omega_{10}$ which is not on $g(S)$. Since $Q$ is not on $g(S)$, the point $f(\\ell) \\neq Q$. Hence, by Lemma 1, the line $\\ell$ is good. Hence, at least eight good lines pass through $S$, so by Lemma 4 , the point $S$ is good. Hence, every point $S \\neq P$ is good, so by Lemma 2 , every line is good. In particular, every line $\\ell$ passing through $P$ is good, and therefore satisfies $f(\\ell)=P$, as required.",
            "Note that for any distinct points $X, Y$, the circles $g(X)$ and $g(Y)$ meet on $X Y$ at the point $f(X Y) \\in g(X) \\cap g(Y) \\cap(X Y)$.

The circles $g(X), g(Y)$ and $g(Z)$ through the vertices of triangle $X Y Z$ meet pairwise on the corresponding edges (produced). By Miquel's theorem, the second points of intersection of any two of the circles coincide. (See the diagram below)\n\n\n<img_3508>\n\n\nNow pick any line $\\ell$ and any six different points $Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{6}$ on $\\ell \\backslash\\{f(\\ell)\\}$. Pick a point $X$ not on $\\ell$ or any of the circles $g\\left(Y_{i}\\right)$.

By applying the above lemma to triangles $X Y_{i} Y_{j}$ for $1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant 4$, we find that the points $s\\left(Y_{i}, Y_{j}\\right)$ and $s\\left(X, Y_{i}\\right)$ are all equal, to point $O$ say. Note that either $O$ does not lie on $\\ell$, or $O=f(\\ell)$, since $O \\in g\\left(Y_{i}\\right)$.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary point $X^{\\prime}$ not on $\\ell$ or any of the circles $g\\left(Y_{i}\\right)$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 4$. As above, we see that there are two indices $1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant 4$ such that $Y_{i}$ and $Y_{j}$ do not lie on $g\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)$.

            "Notice that, for any two different points $X$ and $Y$, the point $f(X Y)$ lies on both $g(X)$ and $g(Y)$, so any two such circles meet in at least one point. We refer to two circles as cutting only in the case where they cross, and so meet at exactly two points, thus excluding the cases where they are tangent or are the same circle.\n\nLemma 1. Suppose there is a point $P$ such that all circles $g(X)$ pass through $P$. Then $P$ has the given property.\n\nProof. Consider some line $\\ell$ passing through $P$, and suppose that $f(\\ell) \\neq P$. Consider some $X \\in \\ell$ with $X \\neq P$ and $X \\neq f(\\ell)$. Then $g(X)$ passes through all of $P, f(\\ell)$ and $X$, but those three points are collinear, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose that, for all $\\epsilon>0$, there is a point $P_{\\epsilon}$ with $g\\left(P_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ of radius at most $\\epsilon$. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Consider a sequence $\\epsilon_{i}=2^{-i}$ and corresponding points $P_{\\epsilon_{i}}$. Because the two circles $g\\left(P_{\\epsilon_{i}}\\right)$ and $g\\left(P_{\\epsilon_{j}}\\right)$ meet, the distance between $P_{\\epsilon_{i}}$ and $P_{\\epsilon_{j}}$ is at most $2^{1-i}+2^{1-j}$. As $\\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i}$ converges, these points converge to some point $P$. For all $\\epsilon>0$, the point $P$ has distance at most $2 \\epsilon$ from $P_{\\epsilon}$, and all circles $g(X)$ pass through a point with distance at most $2 \\epsilon$ from $P_{\\epsilon}$, so distance at most $4 \\epsilon$ from $P$. A circle that passes distance at most $4 \\epsilon$ from $P$ for all $\\epsilon>0$ must pass through $P$, so by Lemma 1 the point $P$ has the given property.\n\nLemma 3. Suppose no two of the circles $g(X)$ cut. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Consider a circle $g(X)$ with centre $Y$. The circle $g(Y)$ must meet $g(X)$ without cutting it, so has half the radius of $g(X)$. Repeating this argument, there are circles with arbitrarily small radius and the result follows by Lemma 2 .\n\nLemma 4. Suppose there are six different points $A, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}, B_{5}$ such that no three are collinear, no four are concyclic, and all the circles $g\\left(B_{i}\\right)$ cut pairwise at $A$. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Consider some line $\\ell$ through $A$ that does not pass through any of the $B_{i}$ and is not tangent to any of the $g\\left(B_{i}\\right)$. Fix some direction along that line, and let $X_{\\epsilon}$ be the point on $\\ell$ that has distance $\\epsilon$ from $A$ in that direction. In what follows we consider only those $\\epsilon$ for which $X_{\\epsilon}$ does not lie on any $g\\left(B_{i}\\right)$ (this restriction excludes only finitely many possible values of $\\epsilon$ ).\n\nConsider the circle $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$. Because no four of the $B_{i}$ are concyclic, at most three of them lie on this circle, so at least two of them do not. There must be some sequence of $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$ such that it is the same two of the $B_{i}$ for all $\\epsilon$ in that sequence, so now restrict attention to that sequence, and suppose without loss of generality that $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ do not lie on $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ for any $\\epsilon$ in that sequence.\n\n\n\nThen $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B_{1}\\right)$ is not $B_{1}$, so must be the other point of intersection of $X_{\\epsilon} B_{1}$ with $g\\left(B_{1}\\right)$, and the same applies with $B_{2}$. Now consider the three points $X_{\\epsilon}, f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B_{1}\\right)$ and $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B_{2}\\right)$. As $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, the angle at $X_{\\epsilon}$ tends to $\\angle B_{1} A B_{2}$ or $180^{\\circ}-\\angle B_{1} A B_{2}$, which is not 0 or $180^{\\circ}$ because no three of the points were collinear. All three distances between those points are bounded above by constant multiples of $\\epsilon$ (in fact, if the triangle is scaled by a factor of $1 / \\epsilon$, it tends to a fixed triangle). Thus the circumradius of those three points, which is the radius of $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$, is also bounded above by a constant multiple of $\\epsilon$, and so the result follows by Lemma 2 .\n\nLemma 5. Suppose there are two points $A$ and $B$ such that $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ cut. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Suppose that $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ cut at $C$ and $D$. One of those points, without loss of generality $C$, must be $f(A B)$, and so lie on the line $A B$. We now consider two cases, according to whether $D$ also lies on that line.\n\nCase 1: D does not lie on that line:\n\nIn this case, consider a sequence of $X_{\\epsilon}$ at distance $\\epsilon$ from $D$, tending to $D$ along some line that is not a tangent to either circle, but perturbed slightly (by at most $\\epsilon^{2}$ ) to ensure that no three of the points $A, B$ and $X_{\\epsilon}$ are collinear and no four are concyclic.\n\nConsider the points $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} A\\right)$ and $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B\\right)$, and the circles $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ on which they lie. The point $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} A\\right)$ might be either $A$ or the other intersection of $X_{\\epsilon} A$ with the circle $g(A)$, and the same applies for $B$. If, for some sequence of $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, both those points are the other point of intersection, the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 4 applies to find arbitrarily small circles. Otherwise, we have either infinitely many of those circles passing through $A$, or infinitely many passing through $B$; without loss of generality, suppose infinitely many through $A$.\n\nWe now show we can find five points $B_{i}$ satisfying the conditions of Lemma 4 (together with $A$ ). Let $B_{1}$ be any of the $X_{\\epsilon}$ for which $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ passes through $A$. Then repeat the following four times, for $2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 5$.\n\nConsider some line $\\ell=X_{\\epsilon} A$ (different from those considered for previous $i$ ) that is not tangent to any of the $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$ for $j<i$, and is such that $f(\\ell)=A$, so $g(Y)$ passes through $A$ for all $Y$ on that line. If there are arbitrarily small circles $g(Y)$ we are done by Lemma 2, so the radii of such circles must be bounded below. But as $Y \\rightarrow A$, along any line not tangent to $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$, the radius of a circle through $Y$ and tangent to $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$ at $A$ tends to 0 . So there must be some $Y$ such that $g(Y)$ cuts $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$ at $A$ rather than being tangent to it there, for all of the previous $B_{j}$, and we may also pick it such that no three of the $B_{i}$ and $A$ are collinear and no four are concyclic. Let $B_{i}$ be this $Y$. Now the result follows by Lemma 4 .\n\nCase 2: D does lie on that line:\n\nIn this case, we follow a similar argument, but the sequence of $X_{\\epsilon}$ needs to be slightly different. $C$ and $D$ both lie on the line $A B$, so one must be $A$ and the other must be $B$. Consider a sequence of $X_{\\epsilon}$ tending to $B$. Rather than tending to $B$ along a straight line (with small perturbations), let the sequence be such that all the points are inside the two circles, with the angle between $X_{\\epsilon} B$ and the tangent to $g(B)$ at $B$ tending to 0 .\n\nAgain consider the points $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} A\\right)$ and $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B\\right)$. If, for some sequence of $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, both those points are the other point of intersection with the respective circles, we see that the angle at $X_{\\epsilon}$ tends to the angle between $A B$ and the tangent to $g(B)$ at $B$, which is not 0 or $180^{\\circ}$, while the distances tend to 0 (although possibly slower than any multiple of $\\epsilon$ ), so we have arbitrarily small circumradii and the result follows by Lemma 2. Otherwise, we have either infinitely many of the circles $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ passing through $A$, or infinitely many passing through $B$, and the same argument as in the previous case enables us to reduce to Lemma 4.\n\nLemmas 3 and 5 together cover all cases, and so the required result is proved.",

Consider one of them. Let $X$ vary on $\\ell$. Then $R_{1}$ is the projection of $X$ to $p_{1}$ via $R_{2}, S_{1}$ is the projection of $R_{1}$ to $g(Q)$ via $Q$.

So, if there were three points $X$ satisfying the conditions of this subcase, the composition of the three projective transforms would be the identity. But, if we apply it to $X=Q$, we successively get some point $R_{1}^{\\prime}$, then $R_{2}$, and then some point different from $Q$, a contradiction.\n\nThus Case 2.2 also occurs for only finitely many points $X$, as desired.\n\nStep 3: We show that $f(P Q)=P$, as desired.\n\nThe argument is similar to that in Step 2, with the roles of $Q$ and $X$ swapped.

Hence $t(X) \\| p_{2}$. Now we recall Case 2.1: we let $t(X)$ cross $p_{1}$ at $R^{\\prime}$, so $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(P R^{\\prime} X\\right)$, and let $R^{\\prime} Q$ meet $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)$ again at $S^{\\prime}$; notice that $S^{\\prime} \\neq Q$. Excluding one position of $X$, we may assume that $R^{\\prime} \\notin g(Q)$, so $R^{\\prime} \\neq f\\left(R^{\\prime} Q\\right)$. Therefore, $S^{\\prime}=f\\left(R^{\\prime} Q\\right) \\in g(Q)$. But then, as in Case 2.1, we get $\\angle(t(Q), P Q)=\\angle\\left(Q S^{\\prime}, S^{\\prime} P\\right)=\\angle\\left(R^{\\prime} X, X P\\right)=\\angle\\left(p_{2}, \\ell\\right)$. This means that $t(Q)$ is parallel to $p_{2}$, which is impossible.\n\nSubcase 3.1.2: $R=f(R X) \\in g(X)$.\n\nIn this case, we have $\\angle(t(X), \\ell)=\\angle(R X, R Q)=\\angle\\left(R X, p_{1}\\right)$. Again, let $R^{\\prime}=t(X) \\cap p_{1}$; this point exists for all but at most one position of $X$. Then $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(R^{\\prime} X P\\right)$; let $R^{\\prime} Q$ meet $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)$ again at $S^{\\prime}$. Due to $\\angle\\left(R^{\\prime} X, X R\\right)=\\angle(Q X, Q R)=\\angle\\left(\\ell, p_{1}\\right), R^{\\prime}$ determines $X$ in at most two ways, so for all but finitely many positions of $X$ we have $R^{\\prime} \\notin g(Q)$. Therefore, for those positions we have $S^{\\prime}=f\\left(R^{\\prime} Q\\right) \\in g(Q)$.

Take $t=v_{p}(b !)$. Then there exist positive integers $c$ such that $a c \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{t+1}\\right)$. If we take $c$ big enough, and then take $n=(p-1) c$, then $a n=a(p-1) c \\equiv p-1\\left(\\bmod p^{t+1}\\right)$ and $a n \\geqslant b$. Since $p \\leqslant b$, one of the terms of the numerator $a n(a n-1) \\cdots(a n-b+1)$ is $a n-p+1$, which is divisible by $p^{t+1}$. Hence the $p$-adic valuation of the numerator is at least $t+1$, but that of the denominator is exactly $t$. This means that $p \\mid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)$, so $p \\nmid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)-1$.

This completes the claim.\n\nTo conclude from here, suppose that $b$ is $a$-good, but $b+2$ is not. Then $b$ is even, and $p \\mid a$ for all primes $p \\leqslant b$, but there is a prime $q \\leqslant b+2$ for which $q \\nmid a$ : so $q=b+1$ or $q=b+2$.

Then consider the expansion of $b$ in base $p$; there will be some digit (not the final digit) which is nonzero, because $p \\leqslant b$. Suppose it is the $p^{t}$ digit for $t \\geqslant 1$.\n\nNow, as $n$ varies over the integers, $a n+1$ runs over all residue classes modulo $p^{t+1}$; in particular, there is a choice of $n$ (with $a n>b$ ) such that the $p^{0}$ digit of an is $p-1$ (so $p \\mid a n+1)$ and the $p^{t}$ digit of an is 0 .

If $b+1$ and $b+2$ are both coprime to $a n+1$ then\n\n\n\nthe ratio is 1 , so that must not be the case. In particular, as any prime less than $b$ divides $a$, it must be the case that either $b+1$ or $b+2$ is prime.\n\nHowever, we can observe that $b$ must be even by insisting that $a n+1$ is prime (which is possible by Dirichlet's theorem) and hence $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right) \\equiv(-1)^{b}=1$.

It is well-known that for every nonnegative integer $d$ the $\\operatorname{sum} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} i^{d}$ is a polynomial in $m$ of degree $d+1$. Thus $\\Sigma_{F}$ may also be regarded as a real polynomial of degree $\\operatorname{deg} F+1$ (with the exception that if $F=0$, then $\\Sigma_{F}=0$ as well). This allows us to consider the values of $\\Sigma_{F}$ at all real points (where the initial definition does not apply).\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ of degree $n$. Then both polynomials $\\Sigma_{P-Q}(x)$ and $\\Sigma_{P^{2}-Q^{2}}(x)$ have roots at the points $0, k, 2 k, \\ldots, n k$. This motivates the following lemma, where we use the special polynomial\n\n$$\nT(x)=\\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-i k)\n$$\n\nLemma. Assume that $F(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial such that $0, k, 2 k, \\ldots, n k$ are among the roots of the polynomial $\\Sigma_{F}(x)$. Then $\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n$, and there exists a polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} F-n$ and $F(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$.\n\nProof. If $\\operatorname{deg} F<n$, then $\\Sigma_{F}(x)$ has at least $n+1$ roots, while its degree is less than $n+1$. Therefore, $\\Sigma_{F}(x)=0$ and hence $F(x)=0$, which is impossible. Thus $\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n$.\n\nThe lemma condition yields that $\\Sigma_{F}(x)=T(x) G(x)$ for some polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} \\Sigma_{F}-(n+1)=\\operatorname{deg} F-n$.\n\nNow, let us define $F_{1}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$. Then for every positive integer $n$ we have\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1))=T(n) G(n)-T(0) G(0)=T(n) G(n)=\\Sigma_{F}(n),\n$$\n\nso the polynomial $\\Sigma_{F-F_{1}}(x)=\\Sigma_{F}(x)-\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(x)$ has infinitely many roots. This means that this polynomial is zero, which in turn yields $F(x)=F_{1}(x)$, as required.\n\n\n\nFirst, we apply the lemma to the nonzero polynomial $R_{1}(x)=P(x)-Q(x)$. Since the degree of $R_{1}(x)$ is at most $n$, we conclude that it is exactly $n$. Moreover, $R_{1}(x)=\\alpha \\cdot(T(x)-T(x-1))$ for some nonzero constant $\\alpha$.\n\nOur next aim is to prove that the polynomial $S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)$ is constant. Assume the contrary. Then, notice that the polynomial $R_{2}(x)=P(x)^{2}-Q(x)^{2}=R_{1}(x) S(x)$ is also nonzero and satisfies the lemma condition. Since $n<\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}+\\operatorname{deg} S=\\operatorname{deg} R_{2} \\leqslant 2 n$, the lemma yields\n\n$$\nR_{2}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)\n$$\n\nwith some polynomial $G(x)$ with $0<\\operatorname{deg} G \\leqslant n$.\n\nSince the polynomial $R_{1}(x)=\\alpha(T(x)-T(x-1))$ divides the polynomial\n\n$$\nR_{2}(x)=T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))+G(x-1)(T(x)-T(x-1)),\n$$\n\nwe get $R_{1}(x) \\mid T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))$. On the other hand,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(T(x), R_{1}(x)\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x)-T(x-1))=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x-1))=1\n$$\n\nsince both $T(x)$ and $T(x-1)$ are the products of linear polynomials, and their roots are distinct. Thus $R_{1}(x) \\mid G(x)-G(x-1)$. However, this is impossible since $G(x)-G(x-1)$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than $n=\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}$.\n\nThus, our assumption is wrong, and $S(x)$ is a constant polynomial, say $S(x)=\\beta$. Notice that the polynomials $(2 P(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha$ and $(2 Q(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha$ are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus obtaining two block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with $P(x)=-Q(x)=T(x)-T(x-1)$. It remains to show that this is impossible.\n\nFor every $i=1,2 \\ldots, n$, the values $T(i k-k+1)$ and $T(i k-1)$ have the same sign. This means that the values $P(i k-k+1)=T(i k-k+1)$ and $P(i k)=-T(i k-1)$ have opposite signs, so $P(x)$ has a root in each of the $n$ segments $[i k-k+1, i k]$. Since $\\operatorname{deg} P=n$, it must have exactly one root in each of them.\n\nThus, the sequence $P(1), P(2), \\ldots, P(k)$ should change sign exactly once. On the other hand, since $P(x)$ and $-P(x)$ are block-similar, this sequence must have as many positive terms as negative ones. Since $k=2 \\ell+1$ is odd, this shows that the middle term of the sequence above must be zero, so $P(\\ell+1)=0$, or $T(\\ell+1)=T(\\ell)$. However, this is not true since\n\n$$\n|T(\\ell+1)|=|\\ell+1| \\cdot|\\ell| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell+1-i k|<|\\ell| \\cdot|\\ell+1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell-i k|=|T(\\ell)|\n$$\n\nwhere the strict inequality holds because $n \\geqslant 2$. We come to the final contradiction.",
            "Assume again that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ of degree $n$. Let $R(x)=P(x)-Q(x)$ and $S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)$.

We prove that $R(x)$ has exactly one root in each segment $I_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, and all these roots are simple.\n\nIndeed, take any $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ and choose some points $p^{-}, p^{+} \\in Z_{i}$ so that\n\n$$\nP\\left(p^{-}\\right)=\\min _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x) \\text { and } \\quad P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=\\max _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x) \\text {. }\n$$\n\nSince the sequences of values of $P$ and $Q$ in $Z_{i}$ are permutations of each other, we have $R\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 0$ and $R\\left(p^{+}\\right)=P\\left(p^{+}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{+}\\right) \\geqslant 0$. Since $R(x)$ is continuous, there exists at least one root of $R(x)$ between $p^{-}$and $p^{+}$- thus in $I_{i}$.\n\nSo, $R(x)$ has at least one root in each of the $n$ disjoint segments $I_{i}$ with $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. Since $R(x)$ is nonzero and its degree does not exceed $n$, it should have exactly one root in each of these segments, and all these roots are simple, as required.\n\nStep 2. We prove that $S(x)$ is constant. \n\nWe start with the following claim.\n\nClaim. For every $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, the sequence of values $S((i-1) k+1), S((i-1) k+2), \\ldots$, $S(i k)$ cannot be strictly increasing.\n\nProof. Fix any $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$. Due to the symmetry, we may assume that $P(i k) \\leqslant Q(i k)$. Choose now $p^{-}$and $p^{+}$as in Step 1. If we had $P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)$, then $P$ would be constant on $Z_{i}$, so all the elements of $Z_{i}$ would be the roots of $R(x)$, which is not the case. In particular, we have $p^{+} \\neq p^{-}$. If $p^{-}>p^{+}$, then $S\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)+Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)+P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=S\\left(p^{+}\\right)$, so our claim holds.\n\nWe now show that the remaining case $p^{-}<p^{+}$is impossible. Assume first that $P\\left(p^{+}\\right)>$ $Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)$. Then, like in Step 1 , we have $R\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 0, R\\left(p^{+}\\right)>0$, and $R(i k) \\leqslant 0$, so $R(x)$ has a root in each of the intervals $\\left[p^{-}, p^{+}\\right)$and $\\left(p^{+}, i k\\right]$. This contradicts the result of Step 1.\n\nWe are left only with the case $p^{-}<p^{+}$and $P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)$(thus $p^{+}$is the unique root of $R(x)$ in $\\left.I_{i}\\right)$. If $p^{+}=i k$, then the values of $R(x)$ on $Z_{i} \\backslash\\{i k\\}$ are all of the same sign, which is absurd since their sum is zero. Finally, if $p^{-}<p^{+}<i k$, then $R\\left(p^{-}\\right)$and $R(i k)$ are both negative. This means that $R(x)$ should have an even number of roots in $\\left[p^{-}, i k\\right]$, counted with multiplicity. This also contradicts the result of Step 1.\n\nIn a similar way, one may prove that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, the sequence $S((i-1) k+1)$, $S((i-1) k+2), \\ldots, S(i k)$ cannot be strictly decreasing. This means that the polynomial $\\Delta S(x)=S(x)-S(x-1)$ attains at least one nonnegative value, as well as at least one nonpositive value, on the set $Z_{i}$ (and even on $Z_{i} \\backslash\\{(i-1) k+1\\}$ ); so $\\Delta S$ has a root in $I_{i}$.\n\nThus $\\Delta S$ has at least $n$ roots; however, its degree is less than $n$, so $\\Delta S$ should be identically zero. This shows that $S(x)$ is a constant, say $S(x) \\equiv \\beta$.\n\nStep 3. Notice that the polynomials $P(x)-\\beta / 2$ and $Q(x)-\\beta / 2$ are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus reaching $P(x)=-Q(x)$.\n\nThen $R(x)=2 P(x)$, so $P(x)$ has exactly one root in each of the segments $I_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. On the other hand, $P(x)$ and $-P(x)$ should attain the same number of positive values on $Z_{i}$. Since $k$ is odd, this means that $Z_{i}$ contains exactly one root of $P(x)$; moreover, this root should be at the center of $Z_{i}$, because $P(x)$ has the same number of positive and negative values on $Z_{i}$.\n\nThus we have found all $n$ roots of $P(x)$, so\n\n$$\nP(x)=c \\prod_{i=1}^{n}(x-i k+\\ell) \\quad \\text { for some } c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\}\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\ell=(k-1) / 2$. It remains to notice that for every $t \\in Z_{1} \\backslash\\{1\\}$ we have\n\n$$\n|P(t)|=|c| \\cdot|t-\\ell-1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|t-i k+\\ell|<|c| \\cdot \\ell \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|1-i k+\\ell|=|P(1)|\n$$\n\nso $P(1) \\neq-P(t)$ for all $t \\in Z_{1}$. This shows that $P(x)$ is not block-similar to $-P(x)$. The final contradiction."

            "Let $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{n}$ be the towns enumerated from left to right. Observe first that, if town $T_{i}$ can sweep away town $T_{j}$, then $T_{i}$ also can sweep away every town located between $T_{i}$ and $T_{j}$.\n\n\nWe also denote by $\\ell_{i}$ and $r_{i}$ the sizes of the left and the right bulldozers belonging to $T_{i}$, respectively. One may easily see that no two towns $T_{i}$ and $T_{j}$ with $i<j$ can sweep each other away, for this would yield $r_{i}>\\ell_{j}>r_{i}$.\n\nClearly, there is no town which can sweep $T_{n}$ away from the right. Then we may choose the leftmost town $T_{k}$ which cannot be swept away from the right. One can observe now that no town $T_{i}$ with $i>k$ may sweep away some town $T_{j}$ with $j<k$, for otherwise $T_{i}$ would be able to sweep $T_{k}$ away as well.\n\nNow we prove two claims, showing together that $T_{k}$ is the unique town which cannot be swept away, and thus establishing the problem statement.\n\nClaim 1. $T_{k}$ also cannot be swept away from the left.\n\nProof. Let $T_{m}$ be some town to the left of $T_{k}$. By the choice of $T_{k}$, town $T_{m}$ can be swept away from the right by some town $T_{p}$ with $p>m$. As we have already observed, $p$ cannot be greater than $k$. On the other hand, $T_{m}$ cannot sweep $T_{p}$ away, so a fortiori it cannot sweep $T_{k}$ away.\n\nClaim 2. Any town $T_{m}$ with $m \\neq k$ can be swept away by some other town.\n\n\n\nProof. If $m<k$, then $T_{m}$ can be swept away from the right due to the choice of $T_{k}$. In the remaining case we have $m>k$.\n\nLet $T_{p}$ be a town among $T_{k}, T_{k+1}, \\ldots, T_{m-1}$ having the largest right bulldozer. We claim that $T_{p}$ can sweep $T_{m}$ away. If this is not the case, then $r_{p}<\\ell_{q}$ for some $q$ with $p<q \\leqslant m$. But this means that $\\ell_{q}$ is greater than all the numbers $r_{i}$ with $k \\leqslant i \\leqslant m-1$, so $T_{q}$ can sweep $T_{k}$ away. This contradicts the choice of $T_{k}$.",
            "We separately prove that $(i)$ there exists a town which cannot be swept away, and that (ii) there is at most one such town. We also make use of the two observations from the previous solutions.\n\nTo prove $(i)$, assume contrariwise that every town can be swept away. Let $t_{1}$ be the leftmost town; next, for every $k=1,2, \\ldots$ we inductively choose $t_{k+1}$ to be some town which can sweep $t_{k}$ away. Now we claim that for every $k=1,2, \\ldots$, the town $t_{k+1}$ is to the right of $t_{k}$; this leads to the contradiction, since the number of towns is finite.\n\nInduction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is clear due to the choice of $t_{1}$. Assume now that for all $j$ with $1 \\leqslant j<k$, the town $t_{j+1}$ is to the right of $t_{j}$. Suppose that $t_{k+1}$ is situated to the left of $t_{k}$; then it lies between $t_{j}$ and $t_{j+1}$ (possibly coinciding with $t_{j}$ ) for some $j<k$. Therefore, $t_{k+1}$ can be swept away by $t_{j+1}$, which shows that it cannot sweep $t_{j+1}$ away - so $t_{k+1}$ also cannot sweep $t_{k}$ away. This contradiction proves the induction step.\n\nTo prove (ii), we also argue indirectly and choose two towns $A$ and $B$ neither of which can be swept away, with $A$ being to the left of $B$. Consider the largest bulldozer $b$ between them (taking into consideration the right bulldozer of $A$ and the left bulldozer of $B$ ). Without loss of generality, $b$ is a left bulldozer; then it is situated in some town to the right of $A$, and this town may sweep $A$ away since nothing prevents it from doing that.

Due to the condition that $m+a_{m} \\neq n+a_{n}$ for $m \\neq n$, each positive integer receives at most one arrow. There are some positive integers, such as 1 , that receive no arrows; these will be referred to as starting points in the sequel. When one starts at any of the starting points and keeps following the arrows, one is led to an infinite path, called its ray, that visits a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Since the length of any arrow is at most 2015, such a ray, say with starting point $s$, meets every interval of the form $[n, n+2014]$ with $n \\geqslant s$ at least once.\n\nSuppose for the sake of contradiction that there would be at least 2016 starting points. Then we could take an integer $n$ that is larger than the first 2016 starting points. But now the interval $[n, n+2014]$ must be met by at least 2016 rays in distinct points, which is absurd. We have thereby shown that the number $b$ of starting points satisfies $1 \\leqslant b \\leqslant 2015$. Let $N$ denote any integer that is larger than all starting points.

            "Define an odd (respectively, even) representation of $n$ to be a representation of $n$ as a sum of an odd (respectively, even) number of distinct elements of $S$. Let $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ denote the set of all positive integers.\n\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there exist only finitely many positive integers that are not clean. Therefore, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that every integer $n>N$ has exactly one odd representation.\n\nClearly, $S$ is infinite. We now claim the following properties of odd and even representations.\n\nProperty 1. Any positive integer $n$ has at most one odd and at most one even representation. Proof. We first show that every integer $n$ has at most one even representation. Since $S$ is infinite, there exists $x \\in S$ such that $x>\\max \\{n, N\\}$. Then, the number $n+x$ must be clean, and $x$ does not appear in any even representation of $n$. If $n$ has more than one even representation, then we obtain two distinct odd representations of $n+x$ by adding $x$ to the even representations of $n$, which is impossible. Therefore, $n$ can have at most one even representation.\n\nSimilarly, there exist two distinct elements $y, z \\in S$ such that $y, z>\\max \\{n, N\\}$. If $n$ has more than one odd representation, then we obtain two distinct odd representations of $n+y+z$ by adding $y$ and $z$ to the odd representations of $n$. This is again a contradiction.\n\nProperty 2. Fix $s \\in S$. Suppose that a number $n>N$ has no even representation. Then $n+2$ as has an even representation containing $s$ for all integers $a \\geqslant 1$.\n\nProof. It is sufficient to prove the following statement: If $n$ has no even representation without $s$, then $n+2 s$ has an even representation containing $s$ (and hence no even representation without $s$ by Property 1).\n\nNotice that the odd representation of $n+s$ does not contain $s$; otherwise, we have an even representation of $n$ without $s$. Then, adding $s$ to this odd representation of $n+s$, we get that $n+2 s$ has an even representation containing $s$, as desired.\n\nProperty 3. Every sufficiently large integer has an even representation.\n\nProof. Fix any $s \\in S$, and let $r$ be an arbitrary element in $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 s\\}$. Then, Property 2 implies that the set $Z_{r}=\\{r+2 a s: a \\geqslant 0\\}$ contains at most one number exceeding $N$ with no even representation. Therefore, $Z_{r}$ contains finitely many positive integers with no even representation, and so does $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\\bigcup_{r=1}^{2 s} Z_{r}$.\n\nIn view of Properties 1 and 3, we may assume that $N$ is chosen such that every $n>N$ has exactly one odd and exactly one even representation. In particular, each element $s>N$ of $S$ has an even representation.\n\nProperty 4. For any $s, t \\in S$ with $N<s<t$, the even representation of $t$ contains $s$.\n\nProof. Suppose the contrary. Then, $s+t$ has at least two odd representations: one obtained by adding $s$ to the even representation of $t$ and one obtained by adding $t$ to the even representation of $s$. Since the latter does not contain $s$, these two odd representations of $s+t$ are distinct, a contradiction.\n\nLet $s_{1}<s_{2}<\\cdots$ be all the elements of $S$, and set $\\sigma_{n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{i}$ for each nonnegative integer $n$. Fix an integer $k$ such that $s_{k}>N$. Then, Property 4 implies that for every $i>k$ the even representation of $s_{i}$ contains all the numbers $s_{k}, s_{k+1}, \\ldots, s_{i-1}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\ns_{i}=s_{k}+s_{k+1}+\\cdots+s_{i-1}+R_{i}=\\sigma_{i-1}-\\sigma_{k-1}+R_{i},\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{i}$ is a sum of some of $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{k-1}$. In particular, $0 \\leqslant R_{i} \\leqslant s_{1}+\\cdots+s_{k-1}=\\sigma_{k-1}$.\n\n\n\nLet $j_{0}$ be an integer satisfying $j_{0}>k$ and $\\sigma_{j_{0}}>2 \\sigma_{k-1}$. Then (1) shows that, for every $j>j_{0}$,\n\n$$\ns_{j+1} \\geqslant \\sigma_{j}-\\sigma_{k-1}>\\sigma_{j} / 2\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNext, let $p>j_{0}$ be an index such that $R_{p}=\\min _{i>j_{0}} R_{i}$. Then,\n\n$$\ns_{p+1}=s_{k}+s_{k+1}+\\cdots+s_{p}+R_{p+1}=\\left(s_{p}-R_{p}\\right)+s_{p}+R_{p+1} \\geqslant 2 s_{p}\n$$\n\nTherefore, there is no element of $S$ larger than $s_{p}$ but smaller than $2 s_{p}$. It follows that the even representation $\\tau$ of $2 s_{p}$ does not contain any element larger than $s_{p}$. On the other hand, inequality (2) yields $2 s_{p}>s_{1}+\\cdots+s_{p-1}$, so $\\tau$ must contain a term larger than $s_{p-1}$. Thus, it must contain $s_{p}$. After removing $s_{p}$ from $\\tau$, we have that $s_{p}$ has an odd representation not containing $s_{p}$, which contradicts Property 1 since $s_{p}$ itself also forms an odd representation of $s_{p}$."

In view of $2^{11}-12>2015$, the claim implies the problem statement.\n\nLet $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $k$. We say that a proper coloring (1) of $G$ is leximinimal, if the $k$-tuple $\\left(\\left|V_{1}\\right|,\\left|V_{2}\\right|, \\ldots,\\left|V_{k}\\right|\\right)$ is lexicographically minimal; in other words, the following conditions are satisfied: the number $n_{1}=\\left|V_{1}\\right|$ is minimal; the number $n_{2}=\\left|V_{2}\\right|$ is minimal, subject to the previously chosen value of $n_{1} ; \\ldots$; the number $n_{k-1}=\\left|V_{k-1}\\right|$ is minimal, subject to the previously chosen values of $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k-2}$.\n\nThe following lemma is the core of the proof.\n\nLemma 1. Suppose that $G=(V, E)$ is a graph with odd chromatic number $k \\geqslant 3$, and let (1) be one of its leximinimal colorings. Then $G$ contains an odd cycle which visits all color classes $V_{1}, V_{2}, \\ldots, V_{k}$.\n\nProof of Lemma 1. Let us call a cycle colorful if it visits all color classes.\n\nDue to the definition of the chromatic number, $V_{1}$ is nonempty. Choose an arbitrary vertex $v \\in V_{1}$. We construct a colorful odd cycle that has only one vertex in $V_{1}$, and this vertex is $v$.\n\nWe draw a subgraph of $G$ as follows. Place $v$ in the center, and arrange the sets $V_{2}, V_{3}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ in counterclockwise circular order around it. For convenience, let $V_{k+1}=V_{2}$. We will draw arrows to add direction to some edges of $G$, and mark the vertices these arrows point to. First we draw arrows from $v$ to all its neighbors in $V_{2}$, and mark all those neighbors. If some vertex $u \\in V_{i}$ with $i \\in\\{2,3, \\ldots, k\\}$ is already marked, we draw arrows from $u$ to all its neighbors in $V_{i+1}$ which are not marked yet, and we mark all of them. We proceed doing this as long as it is possible. The process of marking is exemplified in Figure 1.\n\nNotice that by the rules of our process, in the final state, marked vertices in $V_{i}$ cannot have unmarked neighbors in $V_{i+1}$. Moreover, $v$ is connected to all marked vertices by directed paths.\n\nNow move each marked vertex to the next color class in circular order (see an example in Figure 3). In view of the arguments above, the obtained coloring $V_{1} \\sqcup W_{2} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup W_{k}$ is proper. Notice that $v$ has a neighbor $w \\in W_{2}$, because otherwise\n\n$$\n\\left(V_{1} \\backslash\\{v\\}\\right) \\sqcup\\left(W_{2} \\cup\\{v\\}\\right) \\sqcup W_{3} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup W_{k}\n$$\n\nwould be a proper coloring lexicographically smaller than (1). If $w$ was unmarked, i.e., $w$ was an element of $V_{2}$, then it would be marked at the beginning of the process and thus moved to $V_{3}$, which did not happen. Therefore, $w$ is marked and $w \\in V_{k}$.\n\n\n\n<img_3364>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3603>\n\nFigure 2\n\nSince $w$ is marked, there exists a directed path from $v$ to $w$. This path moves through the sets $V_{2}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ in circular order, so the number of edges in it is divisible by $k-1$ and thus even. Closing this path by the edge $w \\rightarrow v$, we get a colorful odd cycle, as required.\n\nProof of the claim. Let us choose a leximinimal coloring (1) of $G$. For every set $C \\subseteq\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ such that $|C|$ is odd and greater than 1 , we will provide an odd cycle visiting exactly those color classes whose indices are listed in the set $C$. This property ensures that we have different cycles for different choices of $C$, and it proves the claim because there are $2^{k-1}-k$ choices for the set $C$.\n\nLet $V_{C}=\\bigcup_{c \\in C} V_{c}$, and let $G_{C}$ be the induced subgraph of $G$ on the vertex set $V_{C}$. We also have the induced coloring of $V_{C}$ with $|C|$ colors; this coloring is of course proper. Notice further that the induced coloring is leximinimal: if we had a lexicographically smaller coloring $\\left(W_{c}\\right)_{c \\in C}$ of $G_{C}$, then these classes, together the original color classes $V_{i}$ for $i \\notin C$, would provide a proper coloring which is lexicographically smaller than (1). Hence Lemma 1, applied to the subgraph $G_{C}$ and its leximinimal coloring $\\left(V_{c}\\right)_{c \\in C}$, provides an odd cycle that visits exactly those color classes that are listed in the set $C$.",
            "We say that a graph is critical if deleting any vertex from the graph decreases the graph's chromatic number. Obviously every graph contains a critical induced subgraph with the same chromatic number.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose that $G=(V, E)$ is a critical graph with chromatic number $k \\geqslant 3$. Then every vertex $v$ of $G$ is contained in at least $2^{k-2}-1$ unsociable groups.\n\nProof. For every set $X \\subseteq V$, denote by $n(X)$ the number of neighbors of $v$ in the set $X$.\n\nSince $G$ is critical, there exists a proper coloring of $G \\backslash\\{v\\}$ with $k-1$ colors, so there exists a proper coloring $V=V_{1} \\sqcup V_{2} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup V_{k}$ of $G$ such that $V_{1}=\\{v\\}$. Among such colorings, take one for which the sequence $\\left(n\\left(V_{2}\\right), n\\left(V_{3}\\right), \\ldots, n\\left(V_{k}\\right)\\right)$ is lexicographically minimal.

Since the number of such sets $C$ is $2^{k-2}-1$, this proves the lemma. Denote the elements of $C$ by $c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{2 \\ell}$ in increasing order. For brevity, let $U_{i}=V_{c_{i}}$. Denote by $N_{i}$ the set of neighbors of $v$ in $U_{i}$.\n\n\n\nWe show that for every $i=1, \\ldots, 2 \\ell-1$ and $x \\in N_{i}$, the subgraph induced by $U_{i} \\cup U_{i+1}$ contains a path that connects $x$ with another point in $N_{i+1}$. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that no such path exists. Let $S$ be the set of vertices that lie in the connected component of $x$ in the subgraph induced by $U_{i} \\cup U_{i+1}$, and let $P=U_{i} \\cap S$, and $Q=U_{i+1} \\cap S$ (see Figure 3). Since $x$ is separated from $N_{i+1}$, the sets $Q$ and $N_{i+1}$ are disjoint. So, if we re-color $G$ by replacing $U_{i}$ and $U_{i+1}$ by $\\left(U_{i} \\cup Q\\right) \\backslash P$ and $\\left(U_{i+1} \\cup P\\right) \\backslash Q$, respectively, we obtain a proper coloring such that $n\\left(U_{i}\\right)=n\\left(V_{c_{i}}\\right)$ is decreased and only $n\\left(U_{i+1}\\right)=n\\left(V_{c_{i+1}}\\right)$ is increased. That contradicts the lexicographical minimality of $\\left(n\\left(V_{2}\\right), n\\left(V_{3}\\right), \\ldots, n\\left(V_{k}\\right)\\right)$.\n\n<img_3732>\n\nFigure 3\n\nNext, we build a path through $U_{1}, U_{2}, \\ldots, U_{2 \\ell}$ as follows. Let the starting point of the path be an arbitrary vertex $v_{1}$ in the set $N_{1}$. For $i \\leqslant 2 \\ell-1$, if the vertex $v_{i} \\in N_{i}$ is already defined, connect $v_{i}$ to some vertex in $N_{i+1}$ in the subgraph induced by $U_{i} \\cup U_{i+1}$, and add these edges to the path. Denote the new endpoint of the path by $v_{i+1}$; by the construction we have $v_{i+1} \\in N_{i+1}$ again, so the process can be continued. At the end we have a path that starts at $v_{1} \\in N_{1}$ and ends at some $v_{2 \\ell} \\in N_{2 \\ell}$. Moreover, all edges in this path connect vertices in neighboring classes: if a vertex of the path lies in $U_{i}$, then the next vertex lies in $U_{i+1}$ or $U_{i-1}$. Notice that the path is not necessary simple, so take a minimal subpath of it. The minimal subpath is simple and connects the same endpoints $v_{1}$ and $v_{2 \\ell}$. The property that every edge steps to a neighboring color class (i.e., from $U_{i}$ to $U_{i+1}$ or $U_{i-1}$ ) is preserved. So the resulting path also visits all of $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{2 \\ell}$, and its length must be odd. Closing the path with the edges $v v_{1}$ and $v_{2 \\ell} v$ we obtain the desired odd cycle (see Figure 4).\n\n<img_3665>\n\nFigure 4\n\nNow we prove the claim by induction on $k \\geqslant 3$. The base case $k=3$ holds by applying Lemma 2 to a critical subgraph. For the induction step, let $G_{0}$ be a critical $k$-chromatic subgraph of $G$, and let $v$ be an arbitrary vertex of $G_{0}$. By Lemma $2, G_{0}$ has at least $2^{k-2}-1$ unsociable groups containing $v$. On the other hand, the graph $G_{0} \\backslash\\{v\\}$ has chromatic number $k-1$, so it contains at least $2^{k-2}-(k-1)$ unsociable groups by the induction hypothesis. Altogether, this gives $2^{k-2}-1+2^{k-2}-(k-1)=2^{k-1}-k$ distinct unsociable groups in $G_{0}$ (and thus in $G)$."

Denote the points of tangency as in Figure 1. It is well-known that $Q Q_{1}=O O_{1}$ (if $B C \\| P R$, this is obvious; otherwise, one may regard the two circles involved as the incircle and an excircle of the triangle formed by the lines $O Q, P R$, and $B C$ ).

Similarly, the points $R, S$, and $X$ are collinear, as required.\n\nIf the radii of $\\omega_{A}$ and $\\omega_{C}$ are equal but these circles do not coincide, then the degenerate version of the same theorem yields that the three lines $A C, P Q$, and $R S$ are parallel to the line of centers of $\\omega_{A}$ and $\\omega_{C}$.\n\nFinally, we need to say a few words about the case when $\\omega_{A}$ and $\\omega_{C}$ coincide (and thus they also coincide with $\\Omega, \\omega_{B}$, and $\\omega_{D}$ ).

After such variation, the circle $\\Omega$ changes, so the result obtained above may be applied.",

            "We denote by $[S]$ the area of a polygon $S$.\n\nRecall that each triangulation of a convex $n$-gon has exactly $n-2$ triangles. This means that all triangles in any two Thaiangulations of a convex polygon $\\Pi$ have the same area.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulation of a convex polygon $\\Pi$. If four vertices $A, B, C$, and $D$ of $\\Pi$ form a parallelogram, and $\\mathcal{T}$ contains two triangles whose union is this parallelogram, then we say that $\\mathcal{T}$ contains parallelogram $A B C D$. Notice here that if two Thaiangulations $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ of $\\Pi$ differ by two triangles, then the union of these triangles is a quadrilateral each of whose diagonals bisects its area, i.e., a parallelogram.\n\nWe start with proving two properties of triangulations.\n\nLemma 1. A triangulation of a convex polygon $\\Pi$ cannot contain two parallelograms.\n\nProof. Arguing indirectly, assume that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are two parallelograms contained in some triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$. If they have a common triangle in $\\mathcal{T}$, then we may assume that $P_{1}$ consists of triangles $A B C$ and $A D C$ of $\\mathcal{T}$, while $P_{2}$ consists of triangles $A D C$ and $C D E$ (see Figure 1). But then $B C\\|A D\\| C E$, so the three vertices $B, C$, and $E$ of $\\Pi$ are collinear, which is absurd.\n\nAssume now that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ contain no common triangle. Let $P_{1}=A B C D$. The sides $A B$, $B C, C D$, and $D A$ partition $\\Pi$ into several parts, and $P_{2}$ is contained in one of them; we may assume that this part is cut off from $P_{1}$ by $A D$. Then one may label the vertices of $P_{2}$ by $X$, $Y, Z$, and $T$ so that the polygon $A B C D X Y Z T$ is convex (see Figure 2; it may happen that $D=X$ and/or $T=A$, but still this polygon has at least six vertices). But the sum of the external angles of this polygon at $B, C, Y$, and $Z$ is already $360^{\\circ}$, which is impossible. A final contradiction.\n\n<img_3466>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3722>\n\nFigure 2\n\n<img_3376>\n\nFigure 3\n\nLemma 2. Every triangle in a Thaiangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ of $\\Pi$ contains a side of $\\Pi$.\n\nProof. Let $A B C$ be a triangle in $\\mathcal{T}$. Apply an affine transform such that $A B C$ maps to an equilateral triangle; let $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ be the image of this triangle, and $\\Pi^{\\prime}$ be the image of $\\Pi$. Clearly, $\\mathcal{T}$ maps into a Thaiangulation $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ of $\\Pi^{\\prime}$.\n\nAssume that none of the sides of $\\triangle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ is a side of $\\Pi^{\\prime}$. Then $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ contains some other triangles with these sides, say, $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z, C^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} Y$, and $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} X$; notice that $A^{\\prime} Z B^{\\prime} X C^{\\prime} Y$ is a convex hexagon (see Figure 3). The sum of its external angles at $X, Y$, and $Z$ is less than $360^{\\circ}$. So one of these angles (say, at $Z$ ) is less than $120^{\\circ}$, hence $\\angle A^{\\prime} Z B^{\\prime}>60^{\\circ}$. Then $Z$ lies on a circular arc subtended by $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$ and having angular measure less than $240^{\\circ}$; consequently, the altitude $Z H$ of $\\triangle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z$ is less than $\\sqrt{3} A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} / 2$. Thus $\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z\\right]<\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]$, and $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ is not a Thaiangulation. A contradiction.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to the solution. We say that a triangle in a triangulation of $\\Pi$ is an ear if it contains two sides of $\\Pi$. Note that each triangulation of a polygon contains some ear.\n\nArguing indirectly, we choose a convex polygon $\\Pi$ with the least possible number of sides such that some two Thaiangulations $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ of $\\Pi$ violate the problem statement (thus $\\Pi$ has at least five sides). Consider now any ear $A B C$ in $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$, with $A C$ being a diagonal of $\\Pi$. If $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ also contains $\\triangle A B C$, then one may cut $\\triangle A B C$ off from $\\Pi$, getting a polygon with a smaller number of sides which also violates the problem statement. This is impossible; thus $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ does not contain $\\triangle A B C$.\n\nNext, $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ contains also another triangle with side $A C$, say $\\triangle A C D$. By Lemma 2, this triangle contains a side of $\\Pi$, so $D$ is adjacent to either $A$ or $C$ on the boundary of $\\Pi$. We may assume that $D$ is adjacent to $C$.\n\nAssume that $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ does not contain the triangle $B C D$. Then it contains two different triangles $B C X$ and $C D Y$ (possibly, with $X=Y$ ); since these triangles have no common interior points, the polygon $A B C D Y X$ is convex (see Figure 4). But, since $[A B C]=[B C X]=$ $[A C D]=[C D Y]$, we get $A X \\| B C$ and $A Y \\| C D$ which is impossible. Thus $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ contains $\\triangle B C D$.\n\nTherefore, $[A B D]=[A B C]+[A C D]-[B C D]=[A B C]$, and $A B C D$ is a parallelogram contained in $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$. Let $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ be the Thaiangulation of $\\Pi$ obtained from $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ by replacing the diagonal $A C$ with $B D$; then $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ is distinct from $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ (otherwise $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ would differ by two triangles). Moreover, $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ shares a common ear $B C D$ with $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$. As above, cutting this ear away we obtain that $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ and $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ differ by two triangles forming a parallelogram different from $A B C D$. Thus $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ contains two parallelograms, which contradicts Lemma 1.\n\n<img_3479>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3850>\n\nFigure 5"

            "We split the solution into three steps. In the first of them, we show that the function $f$ is injective and explain how this leads to a useful visualization of $f$. Then comes the second step, in which most of the work happens: its goal is to show that for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ the sequence $n, f(n), f^{2}(n), \\ldots$ is an arithmetic progression. Finally, in the third step we put everything together, thus solving the problem.\n\nStep 1. We commence by checking that $f$ is injective. For this purpose, we consider any $m, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $f(m)=f(k)$. By $(i)$, every positive integer $n$ has the property that\n\n$$\n\\frac{k-m}{n}=\\frac{f^{n}(m)-m}{n}-\\frac{f^{n}(k)-k}{n}\n$$\n\nis a difference of two integers and thus integral as well. But for $n=|k-m|+1$ this is only possible if $k=m$. Thereby, the injectivity of $f$ is established.\n\nNow recall that due to condition $(i i)$ there are finitely many positive integers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ such that $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is the disjoint union of $\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{f(n) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right\\}$. Notice that by plugging $n=1$ into condition $(i)$ we get $f(m)>m$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.\n\nWe contend that every positive integer $n$ may be expressed uniquely in the form $n=f^{j}\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ for some $j \\geqslant 0$ and $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$. The uniqueness follows from the injectivity of $f$. The existence can be proved by induction on $n$ in the following way. If $n \\in\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$, then we may take $j=0$; otherwise there is some $n^{\\prime}<n$ with $f\\left(n^{\\prime}\\right)=n$ to which the induction hypothesis may be applied.\n\nThe result of the previous paragraph means that every positive integer appears exactly once in the following infinite picture, henceforth referred to as \"the Table\":\n\n| $a_{1}$ | $f\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ | $f^{2}\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ | $f^{3}\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ | $\\ldots$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $a_{2}$ | $f\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ | $f^{2}\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ | $f^{3}\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ | $\\ldots$ |\n| $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ |  |\n| $a_{k}$ | $f\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ | $f^{2}\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ | $f^{3}\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ | $\\ldots$ |\n\nThe Table\n\nStep 2. Our next goal is to prove that each row of the Table is an arithmetic progression. Assume contrariwise that the number $t$ of rows which are arithmetic progressions would satisfy $0 \\leqslant t<k$. By permuting the rows if necessary we may suppose that precisely the first $t$ rows are arithmetic progressions, say with steps $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{t}$. Our plan is to find a further row that is \"not too sparse\" in an asymptotic sense, and then to prove that such a row has to be an arithmetic progression as well.\n\nLet us write $T=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{t}\\right)$ and $A=\\max \\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right\\}$ if $t>0$; and $T=1$ and $A=0$ if $t=0$. For every integer $n \\geqslant A$, the interval $\\Delta_{n}=[n+1, n+T]$ contains exactly $T / T_{i}$\n\n\n\nelements of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ row $(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant t)$. Therefore, the number of elements from the last $(k-t)$ rows of the Table contained in $\\Delta_{n}$ does not depend on $n \\geqslant A$. It is not possible that none of these intervals $\\Delta_{n}$ contains an element from the $k-t$ last rows, because infinitely many numbers appear in these rows. It follows that for each $n \\geqslant A$ the interval $\\Delta_{n}$ contains at least one member from these rows.\n\nThis yields that for every positive integer $d$, the interval $[A+1, A+(d+1)(k-t) T]$ contains at least $(d+1)(k-t)$ elements from the last $k-t$ rows; therefore, there exists an index $x$ with $t+1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant k$, possibly depending on $d$, such that our interval contains at least $d+1$ elements from the $x^{\\text {th }}$ row. In this situation we have\n\n$$\nf^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T .\n$$\n\nFinally, since there are finitely many possibilities for $x$, there exists an index $x \\geqslant t+1$ such that the set\n\n$$\nX=\\left\\{d \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\mid f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis infinite. Thereby we have found the \"dense row\" promised above.\n\nBy assumption $(i)$, for every $d \\in X$ the number\n\n$$\n\\beta_{d}=\\frac{f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-a_{x}}{d}\n$$\n\nis a positive integer not exceeding\n\n$$\n\\frac{A+(d+1)(k-t) T}{d} \\leqslant \\frac{A d+2 d(k-t) T}{d}=A+2(k-t) T\n$$\n\nThis leaves us with finitely many choices for $\\beta_{d}$, which means that there exists a number $T_{x}$ such that the set\n\n$$\nY=\\left\\{d \\in X \\mid \\beta_{d}=T_{x}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis infinite. Notice that we have $f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=a_{x}+d \\cdot T_{x}$ for all $d \\in Y$.\n\nNow we are prepared to prove that the numbers in the $x^{\\text {th }}$ row form an arithmetic progression, thus coming to a contradiction with our assumption. Let us fix any positive integer $j$. Since the set $Y$ is infinite, we can choose a number $y \\in Y$ such that $y-j>\\left|f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-\\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\\right)\\right|$. Notice that both numbers\n\n$$\nf^{y}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=f^{y-j}\\left(f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)\\right)-f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f^{y}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-\\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\\right)=(y-j) T_{x}\n$$\n\nare divisible by $y-j$. Thus, the difference between these numbers is also divisible by $y-j$. Since the absolute value of this difference is less than $y-j$, it has to vanish, so we get $f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=$ $a_{x}+j \\cdot T_{x}$.\n\nHence, it is indeed true that all rows of the Table are arithmetic progressions.\n\nStep 3. Keeping the above notation in force, we denote the step of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ row of the table by $T_{i}$.\n\n<img_3584>\n\n$$\nT=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo see this, let any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be given and denote the index of the row in which it appears in the Table by $i$. Then we have $f^{j}(n)=n+j \\cdot T_{i}$ for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, and thus indeed\n\n$$\nf(n+T)-f(n)=f^{1+T / T_{i}}(n)-f(n)=\\left(n+T+T_{i}\\right)-\\left(n+T_{i}\\right)=T .\n$$\n\nThis concludes the solution."

            "Replace every cross (i.e. intersection of two circles) by two small circle arcs that indicate the direction in which the snail should leave the cross (see Figure 1.1). Notice that the placement of the small arcs does not depend on the direction of moving on the curves; no matter which direction the snail is moving on the circle arcs, he will follow the same curves (see Figure 1.2). In this way we have a set of curves, that are the possible paths of the snail. Call these curves snail orbits or just orbits. Every snail orbit is a simple closed curve that has no intersection with any other orbit.\n\n<img_3222>\n\nFigure 1.1\n\n<img_3315>\n\nFigure 1.2\n\nWe prove the following, more general statement.\n\n(*) In any configuration of $n$ circles such that no two of them are tangent, the number of snail orbits has the same parity as the number $n$. (Note that it is not assumed that all circle pairs intersect.)\n\nThis immediately solves the problem.\n\nLet us introduce the following operation that will be called flipping a cross. At a cross, remove the two small arcs of the orbits, and replace them by the other two arcs. Hence, when the snail arrives at a flipped cross, he will continue on the other circle as before, but he will preserve the orientation in which he goes along the circle arcs (see Figure 2).\n<img_3874>\n\nFigure 2\n\nConsider what happens to the number of orbits when a cross is flipped. Denote by $a, b, c$, and $d$ the four arcs that meet at the cross such that $a$ and $b$ belong to the same circle. Before the flipping $a$ and $b$ were connected to $c$ and $d$, respectively, and after the flipping $a$ and $b$ are connected to $d$ and $c$, respectively.\n\nThe orbits passing through the cross are closed curves, so each of the arcs $a, b, c$, and $d$ is connected to another one by orbits outside the cross. We distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1: $a$ is connected to $b$ and $c$ is connected to $d$ by the orbits outside the cross (see Figure 3.1).\n\n\n\nWe show that this case is impossible. Remove the two small arcs at the cross, connect $a$ to $b$, and connect $c$ to $d$ at the cross. Let $\\gamma$ be the new closed curve containing $a$ and $b$, and let $\\delta$ be the new curve that connects $c$ and $d$. These two curves intersect at the cross. So one of $c$ and $d$ is inside $\\gamma$ and the other one is outside $\\gamma$. Then the two closed curves have to meet at least one more time, but this is a contradiction, since no orbit can intersect itself.\n\n<img_3189>\n\nFigure 3.1\n\n<img_3836>\n\nFigure 3.2\n<img_3554>\n\nFigure 3.3\n\nCase 2: $a$ is connected to $c$ and $b$ is connected to $d$ (see Figure 3.2).\n\nBefore the flipping $a$ and $c$ belong to one orbit and $b$ and $d$ belong to another orbit. Flipping the cross merges the two orbits into a single orbit. Hence, the number of orbits decreases by 1 .\n\nCase 3: $a$ is connected to $d$ and $b$ is connected to $c$ (see Figure 3.3).\n\nBefore the flipping the $\\operatorname{arcs} a, b, c$, and $d$ belong to a single orbit. Flipping the cross splits that orbit in two. The number of orbits increases by 1 .\n\nAs can be seen, every flipping decreases or increases the number of orbits by one, thus changes its parity.\n\nNow flip every cross, one by one. Since every pair of circles has 0 or 2 intersections, the number of crosses is even. Therefore, when all crosses have been flipped, the original parity of the number of orbits is restored. So it is sufficient to prove $(*)$ for the new configuration, where all crosses are flipped. Of course also in this new configuration the (modified) orbits are simple closed curves not intersecting each other.\n\nOrient the orbits in such a way that the snail always moves anticlockwise along the circle arcs. Figure 4 shows the same circles as in Figure 1 after flipping all crosses and adding orientation. (Note that this orientation may be different from the orientation of the orbit as a planar curve; the orientation of every orbit may be negative as well as positive, like the middle orbit in Figure 4.) If the snail moves around an orbit, the total angle change in his moving direction, the total curvature, is either $+2 \\pi$ or $-2 \\pi$, depending on the orientation of the orbit. Let $P$ and $N$ be the number of orbits with positive and negative orientation, respectively. Then the total curvature of all orbits is $(P-N) \\cdot 2 \\pi$.\n\n<img_3813>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3783>\n\nFigure 5\n\nDouble-count the total curvature of all orbits. Along every circle the total curvature is $2 \\pi$. At every cross, the two turnings make two changes with some angles having the same absolute value but opposite signs, as depicted in Figure 5. So the changes in the direction at the crosses cancel out. Hence, the total curvature is $n \\cdot 2 \\pi$.\n\nNow we have $(P-N) \\cdot 2 \\pi=n \\cdot 2 \\pi$, so $P-N=n$. The number of (modified) orbits is $P+N$, that has a same parity as $P-N=n$.",
            "We present a different proof of $(*)$.\n\nWe perform a sequence of small modification steps on the configuration of the circles in such a way that at the end they have no intersection at all (see Figure 6.1). We use two kinds of local changes to the structure of the orbits (see Figure 6.2):\n\n- Type-1 step: An arc of a circle is moved over an arc of another circle; such a step creates or removes two intersections.\n- Type-2 step: An arc of a circle is moved through the intersection of two other circles.\n\n<img_3210>\n\nFigure 6.1\n\n<img_3963>\n\nype-1\n\n<img_3811>\n\nFigure 6.2\n\nWe assume that in every step only one circle is moved, and that this circle is moved over at most one arc or intersection point of other circles.\n\nWe will show that the parity of the number of orbits does not change in any step. As every circle becomes a separate orbit at the end of the procedure, this fact proves (*).\n\nConsider what happens to the number of orbits when a Type- 1 step is performed. The two intersection points are created or removed in a small neighbourhood. Denote some points of the two circles where they enter or leave this neighbourhood by $a, b, c$, and $d$ in this order around the neighbourhood; let $a$ and $b$ belong to one circle and let $c$ and $d$ belong to the other circle. The two circle arcs may have the same or opposite orientations. Moreover, the four end-points of the two arcs are connected by the other parts of the orbits. This can happen in two ways without intersection: either $a$ is connected to $d$ and $b$ is connected to $c$, or $a$ is connected to $b$ and $c$ is connected to $d$. Altogether we have four cases, as shown in Figure 7.\n<img_3337>\n\nFigure 7\n\nWe can see that the number of orbits is changed by -2 or +2 in the leftmost case when the arcs have the same orientation, $a$ is connected to $d$, and $b$ is connected to $c$. In the other three cases the number of orbits is not changed. Hence, Type-1 steps do not change the parity of the number of orbits.\n\nNow consider a Type-2 step. The three circles enclose a small, triangular region; by the step, this triangle is replaced by another triangle. Again, the modification of the orbits is done in some small neighbourhood; the structure does not change outside. Each side of the triangle shaped region can be convex or concave; the number of concave sides can be $0,1,2$ or 3 , so there are 4 possible arrangements of the orbits inside the neighbourhood, as shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n<img_3247>\n\nFigure 8\n\nDenote the points where the three circles enter or leave the neighbourhood by $a, b, c, d$, $e$, and $f$ in this order around the neighbourhood. As can be seen in Figure 8, there are only two essentially different cases; either $a, c, e$ are connected to $b, d, f$, respectively, or $a, c, e$ are connected to $f, b, d$, respectively. The step either preserves the set of connections or switches to the other arrangement. Obviously, in the earlier case the number of orbits is not changed; therefore we have to consider only the latter case.\n\nThe points $a, b, c, d, e$, and $f$ are connected by the orbits outside, without intersection. If $a$ was connected to $c$, say, then this orbit would isolate $b$, so this is impossible. Hence, each of $a, b, c, d, e$ and $f$ must be connected either to one of its neighbours or to the opposite point. If say $a$ is connected to $d$, then this orbit separates $b$ and $c$ from $e$ and $f$, therefore $b$ must be connected to $c$ and $e$ must be connected to $f$. Altogether there are only two cases and their reverses: either each point is connected to one of its neighbours or two opposite points are connected and the the remaining neigh boring pairs are connected to each other. See Figure 9.\n<img_3822>\n\nFigure 9\n\nWe can see that if only neighbouring points are connected, then the number of orbits is changed by +2 or -2 . If two opposite points are connected ( $a$ and $d$ in the figure), then the orbits are re-arranged, but their number is unchanged. Hence, Type-2 steps also preserve the parity. This completes the proof of $(*)$.",
            "Like in the previous solutions, we do not need all circle pairs to intersect but we assume that the circles form a connected set.

Therefore,\n\n$$\nR_{c}+P_{c}=A_{c}+1 .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nMoreover, we have four arcs starting from every interior points inside $c$ and a single arc starting into the interior from each intersection point on the circle. By double-counting the end-points of the interior arcs we get $2 A_{c}=4 P_{c}+2 X_{c}$, so\n\n$$\nA_{c}=2 P_{c}+X_{c} .\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nThe relations (2) and (3) together yield\n\n$$\nR_{c}-P_{c}=X_{c}+1\n\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nBy summing up (4) for all circles we obtain\n\n$$\n\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} R_{c}-\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} P_{c}=\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c}+|\\mathcal{C}|\n$$\n\nwhich yields\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{\\text {odd }}\\right|-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{\\text {odd }}\\right| \\equiv \\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c}+n \\quad(\\bmod 2)\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nNotice that in $\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c}$ each intersecting circle pair is counted twice, i.e., for both circles in the pair, so\n\n$$\n\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_{c} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2)\n$$\n\nwhich finishes the proof of the Claim.\n\nNow insert the same small arcs at the intersections as in the first solution, and suppose that there is a single snail orbit $b$.\n\nFirst we show that the odd regions are inside the curve $b$, while the even regions are outside. Take a region $r \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and a point $x$ in its interior, and draw a ray $y, \\operatorname{starting}$ from $x$, that does not pass through any intersection point of the circles and is neither tangent to any of the circles. As is well-known, $x$ is inside the curve $b$ if and only if $y$ intersects $b$ an odd number of times (see Figure 10). Notice that if an arbitrary circle $c$ contains $x$ in its interior, then $c$ intersects $y$ at a single point; otherwise, if $x$ is outside $c$, then $c$ has 2 or 0 intersections with $y$. Therefore, $y$ intersects $b$ an odd number of times if and only if $x$ is contained in an odd number of circles, so if and only if $r$ is odd.\n\n<img_4007>\n\nFigure 10\n\nNow consider an intersection point $p$ of two circles $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ and a small neighbourhood around $p$. Suppose that $p$ is contained inside $k$ circles.\n\n\n\nWe have four regions that meet at $p$. Let $r_{1}$ be the region that lies outside both $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, let $r_{2}$ be the region that lies inside both $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and let $r_{3}$ and $r_{4}$ be the two remaining regions, each lying inside exactly one of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$. The region $r_{1}$ is contained inside the same $k$ circles as $p$; the region $r_{2}$ is contained also by $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, so by $k+2$ circles in total; each of the regions $r_{3}$ and $r_{4}$ is contained inside $k+1$ circles. After the small arcs have been inserted at $p$, the regions $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ get connected, and the regions $r_{3}$ and $r_{4}$ remain separated at $p$ (see Figure 11). If $p$ is an odd point, then $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are odd, so two odd regions are connected at $p$. Otherwise, if $p$ is even, then we have two even regions connected at $p$.\n\n<img_3735>\n\nFigure 11\n\n<img_3575>\n\nFigure 12\n\nConsider the system of odd regions and their connections at the odd points as a graph. In this graph the odd regions are the vertices, and each odd point establishes an edge that connects two vertices (see Figure 12). As $b$ is a single closed curve, this graph is connected and contains no cycle, so the graph is a tree. Then the number of vertices must be by one greater than the number of edges, so\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{\\text {odd }}\\right|-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{\\text {odd }}\\right|=1\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nThe relations (1) and (6) together prove that $n$ must be odd."

Assume therefore that the points $A, H$, and $C$ do not lie in a line and consider the circle $\\omega$ passing through them (see Figure 3). Since the quadrilateral $A B C D$ is cyclic,\n\n$$\n\\angle B A C=\\angle B D C=90^{\\circ}-\\angle A D H=\\angle H A D .\n$$\n\nLet $N \\neq A$ be the intersection point of the circle $\\omega$ and the angle bisector of $\\angle C A H$.

            "For any interesting pair $(E, F)$, we will say that the corresponding triangle $E F K$ is also interesting.\n\nLet $E F K$ be an interesting triangle. Firstly, we prove that $\\angle K E F=\\angle K F E=\\angle A$, which also means that the circumcircle $\\omega_{1}$ of the triangle $A E F$ is tangent to the lines $K E$ and $K F$.\n\nDenote by $\\omega$ the circle passing through the points $K, S, A$, and $T$. Let the line $A M$ intersect the line $S T$ and the circle $\\omega$ (for the second time) at $N$ and $L$, respectively (see Figure 1).\n\nSince $E F \\| T S$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $E F, N$ is the midpoint of $S T$. Moreover, since $K$ and $M$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the line $S T$, we have $\\angle K N S=\\angle M N S=$ $\\angle L N T$. Thus the points $K$ and $L$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the perpendicular bisector of $S T$. Therefore $K L \\| S T$.\n\nLet $G$ be the point symmetric to $K$ with respect to $N$. Then $G$ lies on the line $E F$, and we may assume that it lies on the ray $M F$. One has\n\n$$\n\\angle K G E=\\angle K N S=\\angle S N M=\\angle K L A=180^{\\circ}-\\angle K S A\n$$\n\n(if $K=L$, then the angle $K L A$ is understood to be the angle between $A L$ and the tangent to $\\omega$ at $L$ ). This means that the points $K, G, E$, and $S$ are concyclic. Now, since $K S G T$ is a parallelogram, we obtain $\\angle K E F=\\angle K S G=180^{\\circ}-\\angle T K S=\\angle A$. Since $K E=K F$, we also have $\\angle K F E=\\angle K E F=\\angle A$.\n\nAfter having proved this fact, one may finish the solution by different methods.\n\n<img_3925>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3176>\n\nFigure 2\n\nFirst method. We have just proved that all interesting triangles are similar to each other. This allows us to use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Let $A B C$ be an arbitrary triangle. Choose two points $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ on the side $A C$, two points $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ on the side $A B$, and two points $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ on the side $B C$, in a way that the triangles $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ and $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$ are similar. Then the six circumcircles of the triangles $A E_{i} F_{i}$, $B F_{i} K_{i}$, and $C E_{i} K_{i}(i=1,2)$ meet at a common point $Z$. Moreover, $Z$ is the centre of the spiral similarity that takes the triangle $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ to the triangle $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$.\n\nProof. Firstly, notice that for each $i=1,2$, the circumcircles of the triangles $A E_{i} F_{i}, B F_{i} K_{i}$, and $C K_{i} E_{i}$ have a common point $Z_{i}$ by MiqueL's theorem. Moreover, we have\n\n$\\sphericalangle\\left(Z_{i} F_{i}, Z_{i} E_{i}\\right)=\\sphericalangle(A B, C A), \\quad \\sphericalangle\\left(Z_{i} K_{i}, Z_{i} F_{i}\\right)=\\sphericalangle(B C, A B), \\quad \\sphericalangle\\left(Z_{i} E_{i}, Z_{i} K_{i}\\right)=\\sphericalangle(C A, B C)$.\n\nThis yields that the points $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ correspond to each other in similar triangles $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ and $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$. Thus, if they coincide, then this common point is indeed the desired centre of a spiral similarity.\n\nFinally, in order to show that $Z_{1}=Z_{2}$, one may notice that $\\sphericalangle\\left(A B, A Z_{1}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(E_{1} F_{1}, E_{1} Z_{1}\\right)=$ $\\sphericalangle\\left(E_{2} F_{2}, E_{2} Z_{2}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(A B, A Z_{2}\\right)$ (see Figure 2$)$. Similarly, one has $\\sphericalangle\\left(B C, B Z_{1}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(B C, B Z_{2}\\right)$ and $\\sphericalangle\\left(C A, C Z_{1}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(C A, C Z_{2}\\right)$. This yields $Z_{1}=Z_{2}$.\n\nNow, let $P$ and $Q$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ onto $A C$ and $A B$, respectively, and let $R$ be the midpoint of $B C$ (see Figure 3). Then $R$ is the circumcentre of the cyclic quadrilateral $B C P Q$. Thus we obtain $\\angle A P Q=\\angle B$ and $\\angle R P C=\\angle C$, which yields $\\angle Q P R=\\angle A$. Similarly, we show that $\\angle P Q R=\\angle A$. Thus, all interesting triangles are similar to the triangle $P Q R$.\n\n<img_3569>\n\nFigure 3\n\n<img_3540>\n\nFigure 4\n\nDenote now by $Z$ the common point of the circumcircles of $A P Q, B Q R$, and $C P R$. Let $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ and $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$ be two interesting triangles. By the lemma, $Z$ is the centre of any spiral similarity taking one of the triangles $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}, E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$, and $P Q R$ to some other of them. Therefore the triangles $Z E_{1} E_{2}$ and $Z F_{1} F_{2}$ are similar, as well as the triangles $Z E_{1} F_{1}$ and $Z P Q$. Hence\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1} E_{2}}{F_{1} F_{2}}=\\frac{Z E_{1}}{Z F_{1}}=\\frac{Z P}{Z Q}\n$$\n\nMoreover, the equalities $\\angle A Z Q=\\angle A P Q=\\angle A B C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle Q Z R$ show that the point $Z$ lies on the line $A R$ (see Figure 4). Therefore the triangles $A Z P$ and $A C R$ are similar, as well as the triangles $A Z Q$ and $A B R$. This yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{Z P}{Z Q}=\\frac{Z P}{R C} \\cdot \\frac{R B}{Z Q}=\\frac{A Z}{A C} \\cdot \\frac{A B}{A Z}=\\frac{A B}{A C},\n$$\n\nwhich completes the solution.\n\n\n\nSecond method. Now we will start from the fact that $\\omega_{1}$ is tangent to the lines $K E$ and $K F$ (see Figure 5$)$. We prove that if $(E, F)$ is an interesting pair, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{A E}{A B}+\\frac{A F}{A C}=2 \\cos \\angle A\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nLet $Y$ be the intersection point of the segments $B E$ and $C F$. The points $B, K$, and $C$ are collinear, hence applying PASCAL's theorem to the degenerated hexagon $A F F Y E E$, we infer that $Y$ lies on the circle $\\omega_{1}$.\n\nDenote by $Z$ the second intersection point of the circumcircle of the triangle $B F Y$ with the line $B C$ (see Figure 6). By Miquel's theorem, the points $C, Z, Y$, and $E$ are concyclic. Therefore we obtain\n\n$$\nB F \\cdot A B+C E \\cdot A C=B Y \\cdot B E+C Y \\cdot C F=B Z \\cdot B C+C Z \\cdot B C=B C^{2}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, $B C^{2}=A B^{2}+A C^{2}-2 A B \\cdot A C \\cos \\angle A$, by the cosine law. Hence\n\n$$\n(A B-A F) \\cdot A B+(A C-A E) \\cdot A C=A B^{2}+A C^{2}-2 A B \\cdot A C \\cos \\angle A\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to the desired equality (1).\n\nLet now $\\left(E_{1}, F_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(E_{2}, F_{2}\\right)$ be two interesting pairs of points. Then we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{A E_{1}}{A B}+\\frac{A F_{1}}{A C}=\\frac{A E_{2}}{A B}+\\frac{A F_{2}}{A C}\n$$\n\nwhich gives the desired result.\n\n<img_3657>\n\nFigure 5\n\n<img_3918>\n\nFigure 6\n\nThird method. Again, we make use of the fact that all interesting triangles are similar (and equi-oriented). Let us put the picture onto a complex plane such that $A$ is at the origin, and identify each point with the corresponding complex number.\n\nLet $E F K$ be any interesting triangle. The equalities $\\angle K E F=\\angle K F E=\\angle A$ yield that the ratio $\\nu=\\frac{K-E}{F-E}$ is the same for all interesting triangles. This in turn means that the numbers $E$, $F$, and $K$ satisfy the linear equation\n\n$$\nK=\\mu E+\\nu F, \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\mu=1-\\nu\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\n\n\nNow let us choose the points $X$ and $Y$ on the rays $A B$ and $A C$, respectively, so that $\\angle C X A=\\angle A Y B=\\angle A=\\angle K E F$ (see Figure 7). Then each of the triangles $A X C$ and $Y A B$ is similar to any interesting triangle, which also means that\n\n$$\nC=\\mu A+\\nu X=\\nu X \\quad \\text { and } \\quad B=\\mu Y+\\nu A=\\mu Y\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nMoreover, one has $X / Y=\\overline{C / B}$.\n\nSince the points $E, F$, and $K$ lie on $A C, A B$, and $B C$, respectively, one gets\n\n$$\nE=\\rho Y, \\quad F=\\sigma X, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad K=\\lambda B+(1-\\lambda) C\n$$\n\nfor some real $\\rho, \\sigma$, and $\\lambda$. In view of (3), the equation (2) now reads $\\lambda B+(1-\\lambda) C=K=$ $\\mu E+\\nu F=\\rho B+\\sigma C$, or\n\n$$\n(\\lambda-\\rho) B=(\\sigma+\\lambda-1) C .\n$$\n\nSince the nonzero complex numbers $B$ and $C$ have different arguments, the coefficients in the brackets vanish, so $\\rho=\\lambda$ and $\\sigma=1-\\lambda$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{E}{Y}+\\frac{F}{X}=\\rho+\\sigma=1\n\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nNow, if $\\left(E_{1}, F_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(E_{2}, F_{2}\\right)$ are two distinct interesting pairs, one may apply (4) to both pairs. Subtracting, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{Y}=\\frac{F_{2}-F_{1}}{X}, \\quad \\text { so } \\quad \\frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{F_{2}-F_{1}}=\\frac{Y}{X}=\\frac{\\bar{B}}{\\bar{C}}\n$$\n\nTaking absolute values provides the required result.\n\n<img_3812>\n\nFigure 7",
            "Let $(E, F)$ be an interesting pair. This time we prove that\n\n$$\n\\frac{A M}{A K}=\\cos \\angle A\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nWe introduce the circle $\\omega$ passing through the points $K, S$, $A$, and $T$, together with the points $N$ and $L$ at which the line $A M$ intersect the line $S T$ and the circle $\\omega$ for the second time, respectively. Let moreover $O$ be the centre of $\\omega$ (see Figures 8 and 9). we note that $N$ is the midpoint of $S T$ and show that $K L \\| S T$, which implies $\\angle F A M=\\angle E A K$.\n\n<img_3661>\n\nFigure 8\n\n<img_3754>\n\nFigure 9\n\nSuppose now that $K \\neq L$ (see Figure 8). Then $K L \\| S T$, and consequently the lines $K M$ and $K L$ are perpendicular. It implies that the lines $L O$ and $K M$ meet at a point $X$ lying on the circle $\\omega$. Since the lines $O N$ and $X M$ are both perpendicular to the line $S T$, they are parallel to each other, and hence $\\angle L O N=\\angle L X K=\\angle M A K$. On the other hand, $\\angle O L N=\\angle M K A$, so we infer that triangles $N O L$ and $M A K$ are similar. This yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{A M}{A K}=\\frac{O N}{O L}=\\frac{O N}{O T}=\\cos \\angle T O N=\\cos \\angle A\n$$\n\nIf, on the other hand, $K=L$, then the points $A, M, N$, and $K$ lie on a common line, and this line is the perpendicular bisector of $S T$ (see Figure 9). This implies that $A K$ is a diameter of $\\omega$, which yields $A M=2 O K-2 N K=2 O N$. So also in this case we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{A M}{A K}=\\frac{2 O N}{2 O T}=\\cos \\angle T O N=\\cos \\angle A\n$$\n\nThus (5) is proved.\n\nLet $P$ and $Q$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ onto $A C$ and $A B$, respectively (see Figure 10). We claim that the point $M$ lies on the line $P Q$. Consider now the composition of the dilatation with factor $\\cos \\angle A$ and centre $A$, and the reflection with respect to the angle bisector of $\\angle B A C$. This transformation is a similarity that takes $B, C$, and $K$ to $P, Q$, and $M$, respectively. Since $K$ lies on the line $B C$, the point $M$ lies on the line $P Q$.\n\n\n\n<img_4008>\n\nFigure 10\n\nSuppose that $E \\neq P$. Then also $F \\neq Q$, and by Menelaus' theorem, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{A Q}{F Q} \\cdot \\frac{F M}{E M} \\cdot \\frac{E P}{A P}=1\n$$\n\nUsing the similarity of the triangles $A P Q$ and $A B C$, we infer that\n\n$$\n\\frac{E P}{F Q}=\\frac{A P}{A Q}=\\frac{A B}{A C}, \\quad \\text { and hence } \\quad \\frac{E P}{A B}=\\frac{F Q}{A C}\n$$\n\nThe last equality holds obviously also in case $E=P$, because then $F=Q$. Moreover, since the line $P Q$ intersects the segment $E F$, we infer that the point $E$ lies on the segment $A P$ if and only if the point $F$ lies outside of the segment $A Q$.\n\nLet now $\\left(E_{1}, F_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(E_{2}, F_{2}\\right)$ be two interesting pairs. Then we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1} P}{A B}=\\frac{F_{1} Q}{A C} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{E_{2} P}{A B}=\\frac{F_{2} Q}{A C}\n$$\n\nIf $P$ lies between the points $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, we add the equalities above, otherwise we subtract them. In any case we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{1} E_{2}}{A B}=\\frac{F_{1} F_{2}}{A C}\n$$\n\nwhich completes the solution."

Since $\\angle U I C=90^{\\circ}$, we obtain $\\angle I U C=\\alpha+\\beta$. Therefore $\\angle B I V=\\angle I U C-\\angle I B C=\\alpha=\\angle B A I=\\angle B Y V$, which implies that the points $B, Y, I$, and $V$ lie on a common circle (see Figure 1).\n\nAssume now that the points $I, X$ and $Y$ are collinear. We prove that $\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}$.\n\nLet the line $X U$ intersect $A B$ at $N$.

Moreover, $\\angle B I U=\\alpha=\\angle B N U$. This implies that the quadrilateral $B U I N$ is cyclic, and since $B I$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle U B N$, we infer that $N I=U I$.

            "1, we first prove that the points $B, Y, I, V$ lie on a common circle and $\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}$. The remaining part of the solution is based on the following lemma, which holds true for any triangle $A B C$, not necessarily with the property that $I, X, Y$ are collinear.\n\nLemma. Let $A B C$ be the triangle inscribed in a circle $\\Gamma$ and let $I$ be its incentre. Assume that the line passing through $I$ and perpendicular to the line $A I$ intersects the side $A B$ at the point $Y$. Let the circumcircle of the triangle $B Y I$ intersect the circle $\\Gamma$ for the second time at $V$, and let the excircle of the triangle $A B C$ opposite to the vertex $A$ be tangent to the side $B C$ at $E$. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle B A V=\\angle C A E .\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\rho$ be the composition of the inversion with centre $A$ and radius $\\sqrt{A B \\cdot A C}$, and the symmetry with respect to $A I$. Clearly, $\\rho$ interchanges $B$ and $C$.\n\nLet $J$ be the excentre of the triangle $A B C$ opposite to $A$ (see Figure 2). Then we have $\\angle J A C=\\angle B A I$ and $\\angle J C A=90^{\\circ}+\\gamma=\\angle B I A$, so the triangles $A C J$ and $A I B$ are similar, and therefore $A B \\cdot A C=A I \\cdot A J$. This means that $\\rho$ interchanges $I$ and $J$. Moreover, since $Y$ lies on $A B$ and $\\angle A I Y=90^{\\circ}$, the point $Y^{\\prime}=\\rho(Y)$ lies on $A C$, and $\\angle J Y^{\\prime} A=90^{\\circ}$. Thus $\\rho$ maps the circumcircle $\\gamma$ of the triangle $B Y I$ to a circle $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ with diameter $J C$.\n\nFinally, since $V$ lies on both $\\Gamma$ and $\\gamma$, the point $V^{\\prime}=\\rho(V)$ lies on the line $\\rho(\\Gamma)=A B$ as well as on $\\gamma^{\\prime}$, which in turn means that $V^{\\prime}=E$. This implies the desired result.\n\n<img_3595>\n\nFigure 2\n\n<img_3954>\n\nFigure 3\n\nNow we turn to the solution of the problem.\n\nAssume that the incircle $\\omega_{1}$ of the triangle $A B C$ is tangent to $B C$ at $D$, and let the excircle $\\omega_{2}$ of the triangle $A B C$ opposite to the vertex $A$ touch the side $B C$ at $E$ (see Figure 3 ). The homothety with centre $A$ that takes $\\omega_{2}$ to $\\omega_{1}$ takes the point $E$ to some point $F$, and the\n\n\n\ntangent to $\\omega_{1}$ at $F$ is parallel to $B C$. Therefore $D F$ is a diameter of $\\omega_{1}$. Moreover, $Z$ is the midpoint of $D E$. This implies that the lines $I Z$ and $F E$ are parallel.\n\nLet $K=Y I \\cap A E$. Since $\\angle Y I A=90^{\\circ}$, the lemma yields that $I$ is the midpoint of $X K$. This implies that the segments $I W$ and $A K$ are parallel. Therefore, the points $W, I$ and $Z$ are collinear."

The problem statement is a particular case for $N=100$.\n\nWe start with some preparations. If several given coins together have a total value also of the form $\\frac{1}{k}$ for a positive integer $k$, then we may merge them into one new coin. Clearly, if the resulting collection can be split in the required way then the initial collection can also be split.\n\nAfter each such merging, the total number of coins decreases, thus at some moment we come to a situation when no more merging is possible.

The weight of an arbitrary interval $Y \\in \\mathcal{T}$ will be $w(|Y|)$, where\n\n$$\nw(k)= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } k=1 \\\\ 2 & \\text { if } k \\geqslant 2\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nConsider an arbitrary interval $X \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and its sub-intervals $Y \\in \\mathcal{T}$. Clearly, $X$ has one sub-interval of length $|X|$, two sub-intervals of length $|X|-1$ and so on; in general $X$ has $|X|-d+1$ sub-intervals of length $d$ for every $d=1,2, \\ldots,|X|$. The sum of the weights of the sub-intervals of $X$ is\n\n$$\n\\sum_{Y \\in \\mathcal{T}, Y \\subseteq X} w(|Y|)=\\sum_{d=1}^{|X|}(|X|-d+1) \\cdot w(d)=|X| \\cdot 1+((|X|-1)+(|X|-2)+\\cdots+1) \\cdot 2=|X|^{2}\n$$\n\nSince the intervals in $\\mathcal{S}$ are non-overlapping, every interval $Y \\in \\mathcal{T}$ is a sub-interval of a single interval $X \\in \\mathcal{S}$.

Notice that the multiples of $a_{1}$ are all marked, so the lengths of the intervals in $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ cannot exceed $a_{1}$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary integer with $0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant A-1$ and consider the interval $[x, x+d]$. Let $r_{1}$, $\\ldots, r_{n}$ be the remainders of $x$ modulo $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$, respectively. Since $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are pairwise coprime, the number $x$ is uniquely identified by the sequence $\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}\\right)$, due to the Chinese remainder theorem.\n\nFor every $i=1, \\ldots, n$, the property that the interval $(x, x+d)$ does not contain any multiple of $a_{i}$ is equivalent with $r_{i}+d \\leqslant a_{i}$, i.e. $r_{i} \\in\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, a_{i}-d\\right\\}$, so there are $a_{i}-d+1$ choices for the number $r_{i}$ for each $i$. Therefore, the number of the remainder sequences $\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}\\right)$ that satisfy $[x, x+d] \\in \\mathcal{T}$ is precisely $\\left(a_{1}+1-d\\right) \\cdots\\left(a_{n}+1-d\\right)$.

Therefore, (1) can be continued as\n\n$$\n\\sum_{X \\in \\mathcal{S}}|X|^{2}=\\sum_{Y \\in \\mathcal{T}} w(|Y|)=\\sum_{d=1}^{a_{1}} f(d) \\cdot w(d)=2 \\sum_{d=1}^{a_{1}} f(d)-f(1)\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nHaving the formula (2), the solution can be finished using the following well-known fact: Lemma. If $p$ is a prime, $F(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and $\\operatorname{deg} F \\leqslant p-2$, then $\\sum_{x=1}^{p} F(x)$ is divisible by $p$.\n\nProof.

The term $f(1)=a_{1} \\cdots a_{n}$ is also divisible by $a_{1}$; these two facts together prove that $\\sum_{X \\in \\mathcal{S}}|X|^{2}$ is divisible by $a_{1}$.",

Suppose that\n\n\n\nthe numbers $p=a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}$ and $d$ are as above. Write $A^{\\prime}=\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} a_{i}$ and $A=A^{\\prime} a_{n}$. Mark the points on the real axis divisible by one of the numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ green and those divisible by $a_{n}$ red. The green points divide $\\left[0, A^{\\prime}\\right]$ into certain sub-intervals, say $J_{1}, J_{2}, \\ldots$, and $J_{\\ell}$.\n\nTo translate intervals we use the notation $[a, b]+m=[a+m, b+m]$ whenever $a, b, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor each $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\}$ let $\\mathcal{F}_{i}$ be the family of intervals into which the red points partition the intervals $J_{i}, J_{i}+A^{\\prime}, \\ldots$, and $J_{i}+\\left(a_{n}-1\\right) A^{\\prime}$.

Since the numbers $A^{\\prime}$ and $a_{n}$ are coprime by hypothesis, the numbers $0, A^{\\prime}, \\ldots,\\left(a_{n}-1\\right) A^{\\prime}$ form a complete system of residues modulo $a_{n}$. Moreover, we have $\\left|J_{i}\\right| \\leqslant p<a_{n}$, as in particular all multiples of $p$ are green. So each of the intervals $J_{i}, J_{i}+A^{\\prime}, \\ldots$, and $J_{i}+\\left(a_{n}-1\\right) A^{\\prime}$ contains at most one red point. More precisely, for each $j \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots,\\left|J_{i}\\right|-1\\right\\}$ there is exactly one amongst those intervals containing a red point splitting it into an interval of length $j$ followed by an interval of length $\\left|J_{i}\\right|-j$, while the remaining $a_{n}-\\left|J_{i}\\right|+1$ such intervals have no red points in their interiors.

For this purpose we may argue for fixed $m$ by induction on $i$ using $x_{0}=0$ in the base case $i=0$.

Again it suffices to prove $x_{i+m} \\equiv x_{i}\\left(\\bmod x_{m}^{2}\\right)$ for all integers $i \\geqslant 2$ and $m \\geqslant 1$. As above, we proceed for fixed $m$ by induction on $i$. The induction step is again easy using (1), but this time the base case $i=2$ requires some calculation. Set $L=5 c^{2}$. By (1) we have $x_{m+1} \\equiv L x_{m}+1\\left(\\bmod x_{m}^{2}\\right)$, and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{m+1}^{3}-4 x_{m+1}^{2}+5 x_{m+1} & \\equiv\\left(L x_{m}+1\\right)^{3}-4\\left(L x_{m}+1\\right)^{2}+5\\left(L x_{m}+1\\right) \\\\\n& \\equiv\\left(3 L x_{m}+1\\right)-4\\left(2 L x_{m}+1\\right)+5\\left(L x_{m}+1\\right) \\equiv 2 \\quad\\left(\\bmod x_{m}^{2}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich in turn gives indeed $x_{m+2} \\equiv 2 c^{2}+1 \\equiv x_{2}\\left(\\bmod x_{m}^{2}\\right)$.\n\nClaim 3. For each integer $n \\geqslant 2$, we have $x_{n}>x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} \\cdots x_{n-2}$.\n\nProof. The cases $n=2$ and $n=3$ are clear. Arguing inductively, we assume now that the claim holds for some $n \\geqslant 3$. Recall that $x_{2} \\geqslant 3$, so by monotonicity and (2) we get $x_{n} \\geqslant x_{3} \\geqslant x_{2}\\left(x_{2}-2\\right)^{2}+x_{2}+1 \\geqslant 7$. It follows that\n\n$$\nx_{n+1}>x_{n}^{3}-4 x_{n}^{2}+5 x_{n}>7 x_{n}^{2}-4 x_{n}^{2}>x_{n}^{2}>x_{n} x_{n-1},\n$$\n\nwhich by the induction hypothesis yields $x_{n+1}>x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} \\cdots x_{n-1}$, as desired.\n\n\n\nNow we direct our attention to the problem itself: let any integer $n \\geqslant 2$ be given. By Claim 3 there exists a prime number $p$ appearing with a higher exponent in the prime factorisation of $x_{n}$ than in the prime factorisation of $x_{1} \\cdots x_{n-2}$. In particular, $p \\mid x_{n}$, and it suffices to prove that $p$ divides none of $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n-1}$.\n\nOtherwise let $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ be minimal such that $p$ divides $x_{k}$. Since $x_{n-1}$ and $x_{n}$ are coprime by (1) and $x_{1}=1$, we actually have $2 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-2$. Write $n=q k+r$ with some integers $q \\geqslant 0$ and $0 \\leqslant r<k$. By Claim 1 we have $x_{n} \\equiv x_{r}\\left(\\bmod x_{k}\\right)$, whence $p \\mid x_{r}$. Due to the minimality of $k$ this entails $r=0$, i.e. $k \\mid n$.\n\nThus from Claim 2 we infer\n\n$$\nx_{n} \\equiv x_{k} \\quad\\left(\\bmod x_{k}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow let $\\alpha \\geqslant 1$ be maximal with the property $p^{\\alpha} \\mid x_{k}$. Then $x_{k}^{2}$ is divisible by $p^{\\alpha+1}$ and by our choice of $p$ so is $x_{n}$. So by the previous congruence $x_{k}$ is a multiple of $p^{\\alpha+1}$ as well, contrary to our choice of $\\alpha$. This is the final contradiction concluding the solution."

Thus we obtain\n\n$$\nv_{p}((2 n-1) ! !)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{p}(2 i-1)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{v_{p}(2 i-1)} 1=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{m_{k}} 1=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor .\n$$\n\nIn order to prove the problem statement, consider the rational number\n\n$$\nN=\\frac{(2 a+2 b-1) ! !}{(2 a-1) ! ! \\cdot(2 b-1) ! !}=\\frac{(2 a+1)(2 a+3) \\cdots(2 a+2 b-1)}{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdots(2 b-1)} .\n$$\n\nObviously, $N>1$, so there exists a prime $p$ with $v_{p}(N)>0$. Since $N$ is a fraction of two odd numbers, $p$ is odd.\n\nBy our lemma,\n\n$$\n0<v_{p}(N)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{b}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\right) .\n$$\n\nTherefore, there exists some positive integer $k$ such that the integer number\n\n$$\nd_{k}=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{b}{p^{k}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nis positive, so $d_{k} \\geqslant 1$.

In other words, if $i<j$, the number of digits of $a_{i} X^{i}$ is less than the number of digits of $a_{j} X^{j}$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be the number of digits of $a_{n-1} X^{n-1}$, thus $10^{\\alpha-1} \\leqslant a_{n-1} X^{n-1}<10^{\\alpha}$.

If $a_{0} \\neq 0$ then $a_{2 a_{0}}=a_{0}$. Otherwise, $a_{a_{i}}=a_{i}$ for all $i$, so take $i$ such that $a_{i} \\neq i$ (which we can do by our earlier assumption).\n\nLemma 4.

We prove each in turn:\n\n1. The \"if\" implication is clear from Lemma 1. For the reverse direction, suppose $a_{u}=a_{v}$. Then there are integers $r \\leqslant u_{0}, v_{0}<r+d$ such that $d \\mid u-u_{0}, v-v_{0}$, so $a_{u_{0}}=a_{u}=a_{v}=$ $a_{v_{0}}$. If $u_{0}<v_{0}$ then $a_{r+d+u_{0}-v_{0}}=a_{r+d}=a_{r}$, contradicting the minimality of $d$. There is a similar contradiction when $u_{0}>v_{0}$. Thus $u_{0}=v_{0}$, so $d \\mid u-v$.\n2. If $r=0$ there is nothing to prove. Otherwise $a_{0}=a_{2 a_{0}}$ so $2 a_{0}=0$. Then we have $a_{a_{i}}=a_{i}$ for all $i$, so $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r$.\n\nLemma 5. Either\n\n1. $d \\mid a_{i}-i$ for all $i$, or\n2. $r=0$ and $d \\mid a_{i}-i-d / 2$ for all $i$.\n\n\nProof. Note that Lemma 4 tells us that if $a_{u}=a_{v}$ then $d \\mid u-v$. Since $a_{a_{i}+a_{0}}=a_{i}$ for all $i$, we have $d \\mid a_{i}-i+a_{0}$. For $i=0$, this means that $d \\mid 2 a_{0}$. If $d \\mid a_{0}$ then that means that $d \\mid a_{i}-i$ for all $i$. Otherwise, if $d \\nmid a_{0}$, then $d \\mid a_{0}-d / 2$ and thus $d \\mid a_{i}-i-d / 2$ for all $i$. In addition, part 2 of Lemma 4 says that we must have $r=0$ in this case.\n\nLemma 6. If $d$ is even and $d \\mid a_{0}-d / 2$, then $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ is small. (Note that we must have $r=0$ in this case.)\n\nProof. Note that if $d \\leqslant k+1$, then by Lemma $2,\\left(a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{d-1}\\right)$ is a period for the sequence consisting of elements at most $k$, so $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ must be small. Now suppose $d>k+1$. We show that $a_{i} \\leqslant k$ for all $i$ by induction. Note that Lemma 2 already establishes this for $i \\leqslant k$. We must have $d \\mid a_{d / 2}$ and $a_{d / 2} \\leqslant k<d$ so $a_{d / 2}=0$. Thus, for $i>k$, if $a_{j} \\leqslant k$ for $j<i$, then $a_{i-d / 2} \\leqslant k$, So $a_{i}=a_{(i-d / 2)+d / 2}=a_{a_{i-d / 2}} \\leqslant k$.\n\nLemma 7. If $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ is small, then $r+d \\leqslant k+1$.\n\nProof. Since $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ is small, there exists $u, v \\leqslant k+1$ such that $u<v$ and $a_{u}=a_{v}$. Thus $u \\leqslant r$ and $d \\mid v-u$, so $r+d \\leqslant v \\leqslant k+1$.\n\nLemma 8. If $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ is large, then $r+d>k+1$ and $a_{i}=i$ for all $0 \\leqslant i<r+d$.\n\nProof. Since $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ is large and has period $d$ and offset $r$, the period $\\left(a_{r}, \\ldots, a_{r+d-1}\\right)$ must have an element that is larger than $k$, so by Lemma 2 we must have $r+d-1>k$.\n\nWe already have $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r$. Now we show that $a_{i}=i$ for $r \\leqslant i \\leqslant k$. By Lemma 6 we have $d \\mid a_{i}-i$ but $r \\leqslant i \\leqslant k$. Since $k-r+1>d$, this means that $a_{i}=i$ for $i \\leqslant k$.\n\nFinally, one can show inductively that $a_{i}=i$ for $k<i<r+d$. Indeed, if $a_{j}=j$ for all $j<i$, then $a_{i} \\geqslant i$ (otherwise $a_{i}=a_{j}$ for some $j<i$, but then $r \\leqslant j$ and $i<r+d$ means that $d \\nmid j-i$.) However, $a_{i}+(n-i)=a_{i}+a_{n-i} \\leqslant n$, so $a_{i}=i$.\n\nThus large sequences are determined by $r$ and $d$. It is not hard to check that all sequences of the form $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r+d$ and with period $d$ and offset $r$ are $n$-sequences. There are $(n-k-1)(n+k+2) / 2$ possible choices of $(r, d)$ where $0 \\leqslant r<n, d \\geqslant 1$, and $k+1<r+d \\leqslant n$.\n\nFor small sequences, for a given period $d$ and offset $r$, we need to choose the period $\\left(a_{r}, \\ldots, a_{r+d-1}\\right)$ satisfying $r \\leqslant a j \\leqslant k$ and $d \\mid a_{j}-j$ for $r \\leqslant j<r+d$. There are $g(k+1-r, d)$ such choices, where we define $g(x, d)$ to be $(p+1)^{q} p^{d-q}$ with $p=\\lfloor x / d\\rfloor$ and $q=x-d p$.\n\nFurthermore, if $d$ is even then there are $g(k+1, d)$ choices for the period $\\left(a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{d-1}\\right)$ satisfying $d \\mid a_{j}-j-d / 2$ for $j<d$. Again it is not hard to check that, once these choices are made, then the resulting sequence is an $n$-sequence.\n\nThus the total number of $n$-sequences is\n\n$$\nf(n)=1+\\frac{(n-k-1)(n+k+2)}{2}+\\sum_{d^{\\prime}=1}^{\\lfloor(k+1) / 2\\rfloor} g\\left(k+1,2 d^{\\prime}\\right)+\\sum_{r=0}^{k} \\sum_{d=1}^{k+1-r} g(k+1-r, d)\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nNow, to show that $f(n)>c_{1} \\lambda^{n}$ for some $c_{1}$, we note that\n\n$$\nf(n)>g\\left(k+1,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{k+1}{3}\\right\\rfloor\\right) \\geqslant 3^{\\lfloor(k+1) / 3\\rfloor}>3^{n / 6}-1\n$$\n\nTo show that $f(n)<c_{2} \\lambda^{n}$ for some $c_{2}$, it actually suffices to show that there is a positive real number $c_{3}$ such that for all positive integers $x$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{d=1}^{x} g(x, d) \\leqslant c_{3} 3^{x / 3}\n$$\n\nIn fact, the following lemma suffices, as it bounds the left hand side of the above inequality by a pair of geometric series with initial term $3^{x / 3}$ :\n\n\n\nLemma. For positive $d, x$, we have:\n\n$$\ng(x, d) \\leqslant \\begin{cases}3^{x / 3}\\left(\\frac{64}{81}\\right)^{x / 3-d}, & \\text { if } d \\leqslant x / 3 \\\\ 3^{x / 3}\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^{d-x / 3}, & \\text { if } d \\geqslant x / 3\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nProof. There are a few key observations needed, all of which are immediate from the definition:\n\n- $(x, d)$ is the maximum product of a sequence of $d$ integers that sums to $x$.\n- For any positive integer $k$, we have $g(k x, k d)=g(x, d)^{k}$.\n- If $2 d \\leqslant x \\leqslant 3 d$, then $g(x, d)=2^{3 d-x} 3^{x-2 d}$. Likewise, if $3 d \\leqslant x \\leqslant 4 d$ then $g(x, d)=$ $3^{4 d-x} 4^{x-3 d}$.\n\nWith these observations, if $d \\leqslant x / 3$, then\n\n$$\n3^{4(x-3 d)} g(3 x, 3 d) \\leqslant g(3 x+12(x-3 d), 3 d+4(x-3 d))=g(15 x-36 d, 4 x-9 d)\n$$\n\nTo calculate $g(15 x-36 d, 4 x-9 d)$, note that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3(4 x-9 d)=12 x-27 d \\leqslant 15 x-36 d \\\\\n& 4(4 x-9 d)=16 x-36 d \\geqslant 15 x-36 d\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\ng(15 x-36 d, 4 x-9 d)=3^{4(4 x-9 d)-(15 x-36 d)} 4^{(15 x-36 d)-3(4 x-9 d)}=3^{x} 4^{3(x-3 d)} .\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\ng(x, d)^{3}=g(3 x, 3 d)=\\frac{3^{4(x-3 d)} g(3 x, 3 d)}{3^{4(x-3 d)}} \\leqslant \\frac{3^{x} 4^{3(x-3 d)}}{3^{4(x-3 d)}}=3^{x}\\left(\\frac{64}{81}\\right)^{x-3 d},\n$$\n\nwhich completes the proof of the first claim. Likewise, if $d \\geqslant x / 3$,\n\n$$\n3^{2(3 d-x)} g(3 x, 3 d) 3 \\leqslant g(3 x+6(3 d-x), 3 d+2(3 d-x))=g(18 d-3 x, 9 d-2 x) .\n$$\n\nAgain we have\n\n$$\n2(9 d-2 x) \\leqslant 18-3 x \\leqslant 18-3 x+3(3 d-x)=3(9 d-2 x),\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\ng(18 d-3 x, 9 d-2 x)=2^{3(9 d-2 x)-(18 d-3 x)} 3^{(18 d-3 x)-2(9 d-2 x)}=2^{3(3 d-x)} 3^{x} .\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\ng(x, d)^{3}=g(3 x, 3 d)=\\frac{2^{3(3 d-x)} g(3 x, 3 d)}{3^{2(3 d-x)}} \\leqslant \\frac{2^{3(3 d-x) 3^{x}}}{3^{2(3 d-x)}}=3^{x}\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^{3 d-x}\n$$\n\nfrom which the second claim follows."

The resulting function $f^{+}$is nice.\n\nProof. Note that $f^{+}\\left(X_{i}\\right)=f\\left(X_{i}\\right)+\\left|X_{i} \\cap X_{l}\\right|$ holds for all $X_{i}$. We show that $f^{+}\\left(X_{i}\\right)$ is maximized at the unique index $i=l$. Hence consider some arbitrary index $j \\neq l$. Then $X_{l} \\subset X_{j}$ is impossible, as this would imply $f\\left(X_{j}\\right)>f\\left(X_{l}\\right)$ and thereby contradict the choice of set $X_{l}$; this in particular yields $\\left|X_{l}\\right|>\\left|X_{j} \\cap X_{l}\\right|$.\n\n$$\nf^{+}\\left(X_{l}\\right)=f\\left(X_{l}\\right)+\\left|X_{l}\\right| \\geqslant f\\left(X_{j}\\right)+\\left|X_{l}\\right|>f\\left(X_{j}\\right)+\\left|X_{j} \\cap X_{l}\\right|=f^{+}\\left(X_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe first inequality follows since $X_{l}$ was chosen to maximize the value $f\\left(X_{l}\\right)$. The second (strict) inequality follows from $\\left|X_{l}\\right|>\\left|X_{j} \\cap X_{l}\\right|$ as observed above. This completes the proof of the claim.\n\nNext observe that function $f$ can be uniquely reconstructed from $f^{+}$: the claim yields that $f^{+}$has a unique maximizer $X_{l}$, and by decreasing the value of $f^{+}$on $X_{l}$ by 1 , we get we can fully determine the values of $f$. As each of the $n^{n}$ functions $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ yields a (unique) corresponding nice function $f^{+}: X \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$, the proof is complete."

For every point $O$ and $d>0$, denote by $(O, d)$ the circle centred at $O$ with radius $d$, and define $\\omega_{I}=(I, I H)$ and $\\omega_{A}=(A, A H)$. Let $\\omega_{K}$ and $\\omega_{P}$ be the incircle of triangle $K B C$ and the $P$-excircle of triangle $P B C$, respectively.\n\nSince $I H \\perp B C$ and $A H \\perp B C$, the circles $\\omega_{A}$ and $\\omega_{I}$ are tangent to each other at $H$. So, $H$ is the external homothetic centre of $\\omega_{A}$ and $\\omega_{I}$. From the complete quadrangle $B C E F$ we have $(A, I ; Q, H)=-1$, therefore $Q$ is the internal homothetic centre of $\\omega_{A}$ and $\\omega_{I}$. Since $B A$ and $C A$ are the external bisectors of angles $\\angle K B C$ and $\\angle K C B$, circle $\\omega_{A}$ is the $K$-excircle in triangle $B K C$.

Let point $T$ be the tangency point of $\\omega_{P}$ and $B C$, and let $T^{\\prime}$ be the tangency point of $\\omega_{K}$ and $B C$. Since $\\omega_{I}$ is the incircle and $\\omega_{P}$ is the $P$-excircle of $P B C, T C=B H$ and since $\\omega_{K}$ is the incircle and $\\omega_{A}$ is the $K$-excircle of $K B C, T^{\\prime} C=B H$.

Similarly one can show that $Q, S$ and $P$ are collinear, and the result follows.",
            "Again, let $B E$ and $C F$ meet at $I$, that is the incentre in triangle $B C P$; then $P I$ is the third angle bisector. From the tangent segments of the incircle we have $B P-C P=$ $B H-C H$; hence, the possible points $P$ lie on a branch of a hyperbola $\\mathcal{H}$ with foci $B, C$, and $H$ is a vertex of $\\mathcal{H}$. Since $P I$ bisects the angle between the radii $B P$ and $C P$ of the hyperbola, line $P I$ is tangent to $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n<img_3308>\n\nLet $K$ be the second intersection of $P Q$ and $\\mathcal{H}$, we will show that $A K$ is tangent to $\\mathcal{H}$ at $K$; this property determines $K$.\n\nLet $G=K I \\cap A P$ and $M=P I \\cap A K$. From the complete quadrangle $B C E F$ we can see that $(H, Q ; I, A)$ is harmonic, so in the complete quadrangle $A P I K$, point $H$ lies on line $G M$.\n\nConsider triangle $A I M$. Its side $A I$ is tangent to $\\mathcal{H}$ at $H$, the side $I M$ is tangent to $\\mathcal{H}$ at $P$, and $K$ is a common point of the third side $A M$ and the hyperbola such that the lines $A P$, $I K$ and $M H$ are concurrent at the generalised Gergonne-point $G$.

In any triangle, the homothety with ratio $-\\frac{1}{2}$ centred at the centroid of the triangle takes the vertices to the midpoints of the opposite sides and it takes the orthocentre to the circumcentre. Therefore the triangles $A B C$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ share the same centroid $G$ and the midpoints of their sides lie on a circle $\\rho$ with centre on $O H$. We will prove that $\\omega, \\Omega$, and $\\rho$ are coaxial, so in particular it follows that their centres are collinear on $O H$.\n\nLet $D=B B^{\\prime} \\cap C C^{\\prime}, E=C C^{\\prime} \\cap A A^{\\prime}, F=A A^{\\prime} \\cap B B^{\\prime}, S=B C^{\\prime} \\cap B^{\\prime} C$, and $T=B C \\cap B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$. Since $D, S$, and $T$ are the intersections of opposite sides and of the diagonals in the quadrilateral $B B^{\\prime} C C^{\\prime}$ inscribed in $\\omega$, by Brocard's theorem triangle $D S T$ is self-polar with respect to $\\omega$, i.e. each vertex is the pole of the opposite side. We apply this in two ways.\n\n<img_3931>\n\nFirst, from $D$ being the pole of $S T$ it follows that the inverse $D^{*}$ of $D$ with respect to $\\omega$ is the projection of $D$ onto $S T$. In particular, $D^{*}$ lies on the circle with diameter $S D$. If $N$ denotes the midpoint of $S D$ and $R$ the radius of $\\omega$, then the power of $O$ with respect to this circle is $O N^{2}-N D^{2}=O D \\cdot O D^{*}=R^{2}$. By rearranging, we see that $N D^{2}$ is the power of $N$ with respect to $\\omega$.\n\nSecond, from $T$ being the pole of $S D$ it follows that $O T$ is perpendicular to $S D$. Let $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ denote the midpoints of $B C$ and $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$. Then since $O M \\perp B C$ and $O M^{\\prime} \\perp B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ it follows that $O M M^{\\prime} T$ is cyclic and\n\n$$\n\\sphericalangle(S D, B C)=\\sphericalangle(O T, O M)=\\sphericalangle\\left(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}, M M^{\\prime}\\right) .\n$$\n\nFrom $B B^{\\prime} C C^{\\prime}$ being cyclic we also have $\\sphericalangle\\left(B C, B B^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(C C^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right)$, hence we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sphericalangle\\left(S D, B B^{\\prime}\\right) & =\\sphericalangle(S D, B C)+\\sphericalangle\\left(B C, B B^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sphericalangle\\left(B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}, M M^{\\prime}\\right)+\\sphericalangle\\left(C C^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(C C^{\\prime}, M M^{\\prime}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow from the homothety mentioned in the beginning, we know that $M M^{\\prime}$ is parallel to $A A^{\\prime}$, hence the above implies that $\\sphericalangle\\left(S D, B B^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(C C^{\\prime}, A A^{\\prime}\\right)$, which shows that $\\Omega$ is tangent to $S D$ at $D$. In particular, $N D^{2}$ is also the power of $N$ with respect to $\\Omega$.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, from $B B^{\\prime} C C^{\\prime}$ being cyclic it follows that triangles $D B C$ and $D C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$ are inversely similar, so $\\sphericalangle\\left(B B^{\\prime}, D M^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(D M, C C^{\\prime}\\right)$.

Hence $N$ has the same power with respect to $\\omega$, $\\Omega$, and $\\rho$.\n\nBy the same arguments there exist points on the tangents to $\\Omega$ at $E$ and $F$ which have the same power with respect to $\\omega, \\Omega$, and $\\rho$. The tangents to a given circle at three distinct points cannot be concurrent, hence we obtain at least two distinct points with the same power with respect to $\\omega, \\Omega$, and $\\rho$.

Additionally, the second observation yields that the quotients $n_{i} / d_{i j}, n_{j} / d_{i j}$ form a pair of friends, which happen to be consecutive integers, thus giving a special integer as desired.\n\nIn order to construct a family of interesting sets, we can start by observing that the set $\\{0,6,8,9,12\\}$ is an interesting set. Using that $72=2^{3} \\cdot 3^{2}$ is the least common multiple of all pairwise differences in this set, we obtain a family of interesting sets by considering\n$$\n\\{72 k, 72 k+6,72 k+8,72 k+9,72 k+12\\}\n$$\nfor any $k \\geqslant 1$. If we consider the quotients (of these numbers by the appropriate differences), then we obtain that the set\n$$\nS_{k}=\\{6 k, 8 k, 9 k, 12 k, 12 k+1,18 k+2,24 k+2,24 k+3,36 k+3,72 k+8\\}\n$$\nhas at least one special integer. In particular, the interval $[1,100 k]$ contains the sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{k}$, each of which has a special number. Any special number can be contained in at most ten sets $S_{k}$, from where we conclude that the number of special integers in $[1,100 k]$ is at least $k / 10$.\n\nFinally, let $N=100 k+r$, with $k \\geqslant 1$ and $0 \\leqslant r<100$, so that we have $N<100(k+1) \\leqslant$ $200 k$. Then the number of special integers in $[1, N]$ is at least $k / 10>N / 2000$, as we wanted to prove."

Hence, $\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} F_{1}+1 \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} G_{1}+1=\\operatorname{deg} G$.

Notice further that the constraints $g(0)=g(1)=0$ and $g(m)=1$ together enforce $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geqslant 2$.\n\nBy applying the lemma to $a_{1}=\\ldots=a_{n}=m-1$ and the polynomials $f$ and $g$, we achieve $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geqslant \\operatorname{deg} g$.

            "We start by showing that the result of the process in the problem does not depend on the way the operations are performed. For that purpose, it is convenient to modify the process a bit.\n\nClaim 1. Suppose that the board initially contains a finite number of nonnegative integers, and one starts performing type (i) moves only. Assume that one had applied $k$ moves which led to a final arrangement where no more type $(i)$ moves are possible. Then, if one starts from the same initial arrangement, performing type (i) moves in an arbitrary fashion, then the process will necessarily stop at the same final arrangement\n\nProof. Throughout this proof, all moves are supposed to be of type $(i)$.\n\nInduct on $k$; the base case $k=0$ is trivial, since no moves are possible. Assume now that $k \\geqslant 1$. Fix some canonical process, consisting of $k$ moves $M_{1}, M_{2}, \\ldots, M_{k}$, and reaching the final arrangement $A$. Consider any sample process $m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots$ starting with the same initial arrangement and proceeding as long as possible; clearly, it contains at least one move. We need to show that this process stops at $A$.\n\nLet move $m_{1}$ consist in replacing two copies of $x$ with $x+a$ and $x+b$. If move $M_{1}$ does the same, we may apply the induction hypothesis to the arrangement appearing after $m_{1}$. Otherwise, the canonical process should still contain at least one move consisting in replacing $(x, x) \\mapsto(x+a, x+b)$, because the initial arrangement contains at least two copies of $x$, while the final one contains at most one such.\n\nLet $M_{i}$ be the first such move. Since the copies of $x$ are indistinguishable and no other copy of $x$ disappeared before $M_{i}$ in the canonical process, the moves in this process can be permuted as $M_{i}, M_{1}, \\ldots, M_{i-1}, M_{i+1}, \\ldots, M_{k}$, without affecting the final arrangement. Now it suffices to perform the move $m_{1}=M_{i}$ and apply the induction hypothesis as above.\n\nClaim 2. Consider any process starting from the empty board, which involved exactly $n$ moves of type (ii) and led to a final arrangement where all the numbers are distinct. Assume that one starts with the board containing $2 n$ zeroes (as if $n$ moves of type (ii) were made in the beginning), applying type (i) moves in an arbitrary way. Then this process will reach the same final arrangement.\n\nProof. Starting with the board with $2 n$ zeros, one may indeed model the first process mentioned in the statement of the claim, omitting the type (ii) moves. This way, one reaches the same final arrangement. Now, Claim 1 yields that this final arrangement will be obtained when type (i) moves are applied arbitrarily.\n\nClaim 2 allows now to reformulate the problem statement as follows: There exists an integer $n$ such that, starting from $2 n$ zeroes, one may apply type (i) moves indefinitely.\n\nIn order to prove this, we start with an obvious induction on $s+t=k \\geqslant 1$ to show that if we start with $2^{s+t}$ zeros, then we can get simultaneously on the board, at some point, each of the numbers $s a+t b$, with $s+t=k$.\n\nSuppose now that $a<b$. Then, an appropriate use of separate groups of zeros allows us to get two copies of each of the numbers $s a+t b$, with $1 \\leqslant s, t \\leqslant b$.\n\nDefine $N=a b-a-b$, and notice that after representing each of numbers $N+k, 1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant b$, in the form $s a+t b, 1 \\leqslant s, t \\leqslant b$ we can get, using enough zeros, the numbers $N+1, N+2, \\ldots, N+a$ and the numbers $N+1, N+2, \\ldots, N+b$.\n\nFrom now on we can perform only moves of type $(i)$. Indeed, if $n \\geqslant N$, the occurrence of the numbers $n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+a$ and $n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+b$ and the replacement $(n+1, n+1) \\mapsto$ $(n+b+1, n+a+1)$ leads to the occurrence of the numbers $n+2, n+3, \\ldots, n+a+1$ and $n+2, n+3, \\ldots, n+b+1$."

In doing so for each circle, every vertex is coloured twice once for each of the two circles that cross at that point. If the two colourings agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.",

            "Letting $n=2018$, we will show that, if every region has at least one non-yellow vertex, then every circle contains at most $n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor-2$ yellow points. In the case at hand, the latter equals $2018+44-2=2060$, contradicting the hypothesis.\n\nConsider the natural geometric graph $G$ associated with the configuration of $n$ circles. Fix any circle $C$ in the configuration, let $k$ be the number of yellow points on $C$, and find a suitable lower bound for the total number of yellow vertices of $G$ in terms of $k$ and $n$.

The proof hinges on the two lemmata below.\n\nLemma 1. Let two circles in the configuration cross at $x$ and $y$. Then $x$ and $y$ are either both yellow or both non-yellow.\n\nProof. This is because the numbers of interior vertices on the four $\\operatorname{arcs} x$ and $y$ determine on the two circles have like parities.\n\nIn particular, each circle in the configuration contains an even number of yellow vertices.\n\nLemma 2. If $\\widehat{x y}, \\widehat{y z}$, and $\\widehat{z x}$ are circular arcs of three pairwise distinct circles in the configuration, then the number of yellow vertices in the set $\\{x, y, z\\}$ is odd.\n\nProof. Let $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ be the three circles under consideration. Assume, without loss of generality, that $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ cross at $x, C_{3}$ and $C_{1}$ cross at $y$, and $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ cross at $z$. Let $k_{1}$, $k_{2}, k_{3}$ be the numbers of interior vertices on the three circular arcs under consideration. Since each circle in the configuration, different from the $C_{i}$, crosses the cycle $\\overparen{x y} \\cup \\overparen{y z} \\cup \\overparen{z x}$ at an even number of points (recall that no three circles are concurrent), and self-crossings are counted twice, the sum $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}$ is even.\n\nLet $Z_{1}$ be the colour $z$ gets from $C_{1}$ and define the other colours similarly. By the preceding, the number of bichromatic pairs in the list $\\left(Z_{1}, Y_{1}\\right),\\left(X_{2}, Z_{2}\\right),\\left(Y_{3}, X_{3}\\right)$ is odd. Since the total number of colour changes in a cycle $Z_{1}-Y_{1}-Y_{3}-X_{3}-X_{2}-Z_{2}-Z_{1}$ is even, the number of bichromatic pairs in the list $\\left(X_{2}, X_{3}\\right),\\left(Y_{1}, Y_{3}\\right),\\left(Z_{1}, Z_{2}\\right)$ is odd, and the lemma follows.\n\nWe are now in a position to prove that $(*)$ bounds the total number of yellow vertices from below. Refer to Lemma 1 to infer that the $k$ yellow vertices on $C$ pair off to form the pairs of points where $C$ is crossed by $k / 2$ circles in the configuration. By Lemma 2 , these circles cross pairwise to account for another $2\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k / 2 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ yellow vertices. Finally, the remaining $n-k / 2-1$ circles in the configuration cross $C$ at non-yellow vertices, by Lemma 1, and Lemma 2 applies again to show that these circles cross pairwise to account for yet another $2\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k / 2-1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ yellow vertices. Consequently, there are at least $(*)$ yellow vertices.\n\nNext, notice that $G$ is a plane graph on $n(n-1)$ degree 4 vertices, having exactly $2 n(n-1)$ edges and exactly $n(n-1)+2$ faces (regions), the outer face inclusive (by Euler's formula for planar graphs).\n\nLemma 3. Each face of $G$ has equally many red and blue vertices. In particular, each face has an even number of non-yellow vertices.\n\nProof. Trace the boundary of a face once in circular order, and consider the colours each vertex is assigned in the colouring of the two circles that cross at that vertex, to infer that colours of non-yellow vertices alternate.\n\nConsequently, if each region has at least one non-yellow vertex, then it has at least two such. Since each vertex of $G$ has degree 4, consideration of vertex-face incidences shows that $G$ has at least $n(n-1) / 2+1$ non-yellow vertices, and hence at most $n(n-1) / 2-1$ yellow vertices. (In fact, Lemma 3 shows that there are at least $n(n-1) / 4+1 / 2$ red, respectively blue, vertices.)\n\nFinally, recall the lower bound (*) for the total number of yellow vertices in $G$, to write $n(n-1) / 2-1 \\geqslant k^{2} / 2-(n-2) k+(n-2)(n-1)$, and conclude that $k \\leqslant n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor-2$, as claimed in the first paragraph.",
            "Consider any circle $C$ along with all circles that cross $C$ at yellow points to form one class; the remaining circles then form the other class. Lemma 2 shows that any pair of circles in the same class cross at yellow points; otherwise, they cross at non-yellow points.\n\nCall the circles from the two classes white and black, respectively. Call a region yellow if its vertices are all yellow. Let $w$ and $b$ be the numbers of white and black circles, respectively; clearly, $w+b=n$. Assume that $w \\geqslant b$, and that there is no yellow region. Clearly, $b \\geqslant 1$, otherwise each region is yellow. The white circles subdivide the plane into $w(w-1)+2$ larger regions - call them white. The white regions (or rather their boundaries) subdivide each black circle into black arcs. Since there are no yellow regions, each white region contains at least one black arc.\n\nConsider any white region; let it contain $t \\geqslant 1$ black arcs. We claim that the number of points at which these $t$ arcs cross does not exceed $t-1$. To prove this, consider a multigraph whose vertices are these black arcs, two vertices being joined by an edge for each point at which the corresponding arcs cross. If this graph had more than $t-1$ edges, it would contain a cycle, since it has $t$ vertices; this cycle would correspond to a closed contour formed by black sub-arcs, lying inside the region under consideration. This contour would, in turn, define at least one yellow region, which is impossible.\n\nLet $t_{i}$ be the number of black arcs inside the $i^{\\text {th }}$ white region. The total number of black $\\operatorname{arcs}$ is $\\sum_{i} t_{i}=2 w b$, and they cross at $2\\left(\\begin{array}{l}b \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=b(b-1)$ points.

Consequently, $b \\leqslant w \\leqslant(n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor) / 2$, so there are at most $2(w-1) \\leqslant n+\\lfloor\\sqrt{n-2}\\rfloor-2$ yellow vertices on each circle - a contradiction."

Assume that $b$ is a positive integer such that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<b<a_{n}$ for some $n \\geqslant 3$. Then $b \\sim S_{n-1}-b$.\n\nProof. As seen above, we have $S_{n-1}>a_{n}$. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-b$; then $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<c<a_{n}$, so the roles of $b$ and $c$ are symmetrical.\n\nAssume that $b$ is representable. The representation cannot contain $a_{i}$ with $i \\geqslant n$, since $b<a_{n}$. So $b$ is the sum of some subset of $\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. The converse is obtained by swapping $b$ and $c$.\n\nWe also need the following version of this claim.\n\nClaim 2. For any $n \\geqslant 3$, the number $a_{n}$ can be represented as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence if and only if $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{[n / 2]}-3$ is representable.\n\nProof. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-a_{n}<a_{n}$. If $a_{n}$ satisfies the required condition, then it is the sum of some subset of $\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. Conversely, if $c$ is representable, then its representation consists only of the numbers from $\\left\\{a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$, so $a_{n}$ is the sum of the complement.\n\nBy Claim 2, in order to prove the problem statement, it suffices to find infinitely many representable numbers of the form $2^{t}-3$, as well as infinitely many non-representable ones.\n\nClaim 3. For every $t \\geqslant 3$, we have $2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, and $2^{4 t-6}-3>2^{t}-3$.\n\nProof. The inequality follows from $t \\geqslant 3$. In order to prove the equivalence, we apply Claim 1 twice in the following manner.\n\nFirst, since $S_{2 t-3}-a_{2 t-2}=2^{t-1}-3<2^{t}-3<2^{2 t-2}+2^{t-1}=a_{2 t-2}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{t}-3 \\sim S_{2 t-3}-\\left(2^{t}-3\\right)=2^{2 t-2}$.\n\nSecond, since $S_{4 t-7}-a_{4 t-6}=2^{2 t-3}-3<2^{2 t-2}<2^{4 t-6}+2^{2 t-3}=a_{4 t-6}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{2 t-2} \\sim S_{4 t-7}-2^{2 t-2}=2^{4 t-6}-3$.\n\nTherefore, $2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{2 t-2} \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, as required.\n\nNow it is easy to find the required numbers. Indeed, the number $2^{3}-3=5=a_{0}+a_{1}$ is representable, so Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of representable numbers\n\n$$\n2^{3}-3 \\sim 2^{6}-3 \\sim 2^{18}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the number $2^{7}-3=125$ is non-representable (since by Claim 1 we have $125 \\sim S_{6}-125=24 \\sim S_{4}-24=17 \\sim S_{3}-17=4$ which is clearly non-representable). So Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of non-representable numbers\n\n$$\n2^{7}-3 \\sim 2^{22}-3 \\sim 2^{82}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots\n$$",

We must prove that there are infinitely many good indices, as well as infinitely many bad ones.\n\nLemma 1. If $m \\geqslant 0$ is an integer, then $4^{m}$ is representable if and only if either of $2 m+1$ and $2 m+2$ is good.\n\nProof. The case $m=0$ is obvious, so we may assume that $m \\geqslant 1$. Let $n=2 m+1$ or $2 m+2$. Then $n \\geqslant 3$. We notice that\n\n$$\nS_{n-1}<a_{n-2}+a_{n}\n$$\n\nThe inequality writes as $2^{n}+2^{[n / 2]}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}-3<2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}+2^{n-2}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor-1}$, i.e. as $2^{[n / 2\\rceil}<$ $2^{n-2}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor-1}+3$. If $n \\geqslant 4$, then $n / 2 \\leqslant n-2$, so $[n / 2\\rceil \\leqslant n-2$ and $2^{[n / 2\\rfloor} \\leqslant 2^{n-2}$. For $n=3$ the inequality verifies separately.\n\nIf $n$ is good, then $a_{n}$ writes as $a_{n}=a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}}$, where $r \\geqslant 2$ and $i_{1}<\\cdots<i_{r}<n$. Then $i_{r}=n-1$ and $i_{r-1}=n-2$, for if $n-1$ or $n-2$ is missing from the sequence $i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r}$, then $a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}} \\leqslant a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{n-3}+a_{n-1}=S_{n-1}-a_{n-2}<a_{n}$. Thus, if $n$ is good, then both $a_{n}-a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}$ are representable.\n\nWe now consider the cases $n=2 m+1$ and $n=2 m+2$ separately.\n\nIf $n=2 m+1$, then $a_{n}-a_{n-1}=a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+1}+2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}$. So we proved that, if $2 m+1$ is good, then $2^{2 m}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{2 m}$ is representable, then $2^{2 m}<a_{2 m}$, so $2^{2 m}$ is a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. It follows that $a_{2 m+1}=a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}$ writes as $a_{2 m}$ plus a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Hence $2 m+1$ is good.\n\nIf $n=2 m+2$, then $a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}=a_{2 m+2}-a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+2}+2^{m+1}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m+1}+\\right.$ $\\left.2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}$. So we proved that, if $2 m+2$ is good, then $2^{2 m}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{2 m}$ is representable, then, as seen in the previous case, it writes as a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Hence $a_{2 m+2}=a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}$ writes as $a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}$ plus a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Thus $2 m+2$ is good.\n\nLemma 2. If $k \\geqslant 2$, then $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable if and only if $2^{k+1}$ is representable.\n\nIn particular, if $s \\geqslant 2$, then $4^{s}$ is representable if and only if $4^{4 s-3}$ is representable. Also, $4^{4 s-3}>4^{s}$.\n\nProof. We have $2^{4 k-2}<a_{4 k-2}$, so in a representation of $2^{4 k-2}$ we can have only terms $a_{i}$ with $i \\leqslant 4 k-3$. Notice that\n\n$$\na_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}=2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3<2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}+2^{k}=2^{4 k-2}+a_{2 k} .\n$$\n\nHence, any representation of $2^{4 k-2}$ must contain all terms from $a_{2 k}$ to $a_{4 k-3}$. (If any of these terms is missing, then the sum of the remaining ones is $\\leqslant\\left(a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}\\right)-a_{2 k}<2^{4 k-2}$.) Hence, if $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable, then $2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}$ is representable. But\n\n$2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(S_{4 k-3}-S_{2 k-1}\\right)=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3\\right)+\\left(2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3\\right)=2^{k+1}$.\n\nSo, if $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable, then $2^{k+1}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{k+1}$ is representable, then $2^{k+1}<2^{2 k}+2^{k}=a_{2 k}$, so $2^{k+1}$ writes as a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 k$. It follows that $2^{4 k-2}=\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}+2^{k+1}$ writes as $a_{4 k-3}+a_{4 k-4}+\\cdots+a_{2 k}$ plus the sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 k$. Hence $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable.\n\nFor the second statement, if $s \\geqslant 2$, then we just take $k=2 s-1$ and we notice that $2^{k+1}=4^{s}$ and $2^{4 k-2}=4^{4 s-3}$. Also, $s \\geqslant 2$ implies that $4 s-3>s$.\n\nNow $4^{2}=a_{2}+a_{3}$ is representable, whereas $4^{6}=4096$ is not. Indeed, note that $4^{6}=2^{12}<a_{12}$, so the only available terms for a representation are $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}$, i.e., $2,3,6,10,20,36,72$, 136, 272, 528, 1056, 2080. Their sum is $S_{11}=4221$, which exceeds 4096 by 125 . Then any representation of 4096 must contain all the terms from $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}$ that are greater that 125, i.e., $136,272,528,1056,2080$. Their sum is 4072 . Since $4096-4072=24$ and 24 is clearly not representable, 4096 is non-representable as well.\n\nStarting with these values of $m$, by using Lemma 2, we can obtain infinitely many representable powers of 4 , as well as infinitely many non-representable ones. By Lemma 1, this solves our problem."

            "We use the same notation $s_{n}$.

There are finitely many such primes; therefore, it suffices to prove that the exponent of each of them in the prime factorization of $a_{n}$ is eventually constant.\n\nChoose any prime $p \\mid a_{1} a_{k}$. Recall that $v_{p}(q)$ is the standard notation for the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of a nonzero rational number $q$. Say that an index $n \\geqslant k$ is large if $v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right) \\geqslant v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right)$.

This contradiction shows that index $n+1$ is also large.\n\nOn the other hand, if $v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right)>v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)$, then $v_{p}\\left(a_{n} / a_{n+1}\\right)<0$, while $v_{p}\\left(\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{n}\\right) / a_{1}\\right) \\geqslant 0$, so $(*)$ is not integer again. Thus, $v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right) \\leqslant v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right) \\leqslant v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)$.\n\nThe above arguments can now be applied successively to indices $n+1, n+2, \\ldots$, showing that all the indices greater than $n$ are large, and the sequence $v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right), v_{p}\\left(a_{n+1}\\right), v_{p}\\left(a_{n+2}\\right), \\ldots$ is nonincreasing - hence eventually constant.\n\nCase 2: There is no large index.\n\nWe have $v_{p}\\left(a_{1}\\right)>v_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ for all $n \\geqslant k$.

Let $d=\\min S_{m}$; the definition of $S_{m}$ yields $m \\mid f(d)$.\n\nWhenever $n \\in S_{m}$ and $n>d$, we have $m|f(n)| f(n-d)+f(d)$, so $m \\mid f(n-d)$ and therefore $n-d \\in S_{m}$.

Since the function $f$ is bounded, there are only a finite number of primes that divide at least one $f(n)$; so altogether there are finitely many numbers $n$ such that $f(n)$ has a sporadic prime divisor. Let $N$ be a positive integer, greater than all those numbers $n$.\n\nLet $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ be the frequent primes.

Consider the number\n\n$$\nn=N d_{1} d_{2} \\cdots d_{k}+1\n$$\n\nDue to $n>N$, all prime divisors of $f(n)$ are frequent primes. Let $p_{i}$ be any frequent prime divisor of $f(n)$.

Let $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(a), f(b))$. We can replicate Euclid's algorithm. Formally, apply induction on $a+b$. If $a=1$ or $b=1$ then we already have $d \\mid f(1)$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose $1<a<b$. Then $d \\mid f(a)$ and $d|f(b)| f(a)+f(b-a)$, so $d \\mid f(b-a)$.

Assume that a graph $G$ admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors $(n>1)$. Then one may perform a sequence of operations resulting in a graph which admits a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors.\n\nProof. Let us apply repeatedly operation (i) to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. Since the number of vertices decreases, this process finally results in a graph where all the degrees are even. Surely this graph also admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors $1, \\ldots, n$; let us fix this coloring.\n\nNow apply the operation (ii) to this graph. A proper coloring of the resulting graph in $n$ colors still exists: one may preserve the colors of the original vertices and color the vertex $I^{\\prime}$ in a color $k+1(\\bmod n)$ if the vertex $I$ has color $k$. Then two connected original vertices still have different colors, and so do their two connected copies. On the other hand, the vertices $I$ and $I^{\\prime}$ have different colors since $n>1$.\n\nAll the degrees of the vertices in the resulting graph are odd, so one may apply operation $(i)$ to delete consecutively all the vertices of color $n$ one by one; no two of them are connected by an edge, so their degrees do not change during the process. Thus, we obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors, as required. The lemma is proved.\n\nNow, assume that a graph $G$ has $n$ vertices; then it admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors.

Consider any operation applicable to $G^{\\circ}$ resulting in a graph $G_{1}^{\\circ}$; then there exists a sequence of operations applicable to $G$ and resulting in a graph $G_{1}$ differing from $G_{1}^{\\circ}$ by an addition of an isolated vertex $A$.

If these were the only operations applied, then the resulting graph $G_{n}^{m}$ has the set of vertices which can be enumerated as\n\n$$\nV_{n}^{m}=\\left\\{A_{i}^{j}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n, 0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant 2^{m}-1\\right\\},\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{i}^{0}$ is the common \"ancestor\" of all the vertices $A_{i}^{j}$, and the binary expansion of $j$ (adjoined with some zeroes at the left to have $m$ digits) \"keeps the history\" of this vertex: the $d$ th digit from the right is 0 if at the $d$ th doubling the ancestor of $A_{i}^{j}$ was in the original part, and this digit is 1 if it was in the copy.\n\nNext, the two vertices $A_{i}^{j}$ and $A_{k}^{\\ell}$ in $G_{n}^{m}$ are connected with an edge exactly if either (1) $j=\\ell$ and there was an edge between $A_{i}^{0}$ and $A_{k}^{0}$ (so these vertices appeared at the same application of operation (ii)); or (2) $i=k$ and the binary expansions of $j$ and $\\ell$ differ in exactly one digit (so their ancestors became connected as a copy and the original vertex at some application of $(i i))$.\n\nNow, if some operations $(i)$ were applied during the process, then simply some vertices in $G_{n}^{m}$ disappeared. So, in any case the resulting graph is some induced subgraph of $G_{n}^{m}$.\n\nIII. Finally, we will show that from each (not necessarily induced) subgraph of $G_{n}^{m}$ one can obtain a graph with no vertices by applying operations $(i),($ ii) and (iii). We proceed by induction on $n$; the base case $n=0$ is trivial.\n\nFor the induction step, let us show how to apply several operations so as to obtain a graph containing no vertices of the form $A_{n}^{j}$ for $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We will do this in three steps.\n\nStep 1. We apply repeatedly operation $(i)$ to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. In the resulting graph, all vertices have even degrees.\n\nStep 2. Apply operation (ii) obtaining a subgraph of $G_{n}^{m+1}$ with all degrees being odd. In this graph, we delete one by one all the vertices $A_{n}^{j}$ where the sum of the binary digits of $j$ is even; it is possible since there are no edges between such vertices, so all their degrees remain odd. After that, we delete all isolated vertices.\n\nStep 3. Finally, consider any remaining vertex $A_{n}^{j}$ (then the sum of digits of $j$ is odd). If its degree is odd, then we simply delete it. Otherwise, since $A_{n}^{j}$ is not isolated, we consider any vertex adjacent to it. It has the form $A_{k}^{j}$ for some $k<n$ (otherwise it would have the form $A_{n}^{\\ell}$, where $\\ell$ has an even digit sum; but any such vertex has already been deleted at Step 2). No neighbor of $A_{k}^{j}$ was deleted at Steps 2 and 3, so it has an odd degree. Then we successively delete $A_{k}^{j}$ and $A_{n}^{j}$.\n\nNotice that this deletion does not affect the applicability of this step to other vertices, since no two vertices $A_{i}^{j}$ and $A_{k}^{\\ell}$ for different $j, \\ell$ with odd digit sum are connected with an edge. Thus we will delete all the remaining vertices of the form $A_{n}^{j}$, obtaining a subgraph of $G_{n-1}^{m+1}$. The application of the induction hypothesis finishes the proof."

            "For every indices $m \\leqslant n$ we will denote $S(m, n)=a_{m}+a_{m+1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}$; thus $S(n, n)=0$. Let us start with the following lemma.\n\nLemma. Let $b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots$ be an infinite sequence. Assume that for every nonnegative integer $m$ there exists a nonnegative integer $n \\in[m+1, m+r]$ such that $b_{m}=b_{n}$. Then for every indices $k \\leqslant \\ell$ there exists an index $t \\in[\\ell, \\ell+r-1]$ such that $b_{t}=b_{k}$. Moreover, there are at most $r$ distinct numbers among the terms of $\\left(b_{i}\\right)$.\n\nProof. To prove the first claim, let us notice that there exists an infinite sequence of indices $k_{1}=k, k_{2}, k_{3}, \\ldots$ such that $b_{k_{1}}=b_{k_{2}}=\\cdots=b_{k}$ and $k_{i}<k_{i+1} \\leqslant k_{i}+r$ for all $i \\geqslant 1$. This sequence is unbounded from above, thus it hits each segment of the form $[\\ell, \\ell+r-1]$ with $\\ell \\geqslant k$, as required.\n\nTo prove the second claim, assume, to the contrary, that there exist $r+1$ distinct numbers $b_{i_{1}}, \\ldots, b_{i_{r+1}}$. Let us apply the first claim to $k=i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r+1}$ and $\\ell=\\max \\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r+1}\\right\\}$; we obtain that for every $j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, r+1\\}$ there exists $t_{j} \\in[s, s+r-1]$ such that $b_{t_{j}}=b_{i_{j}}$. Thus the segment $[s, s+r-1]$ should contain $r+1$ distinct integers, which is absurd.\n\nSetting $s=0$ in the problem condition, we see that the sequence $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the lemma, thus it attains at most $r$ distinct values. Denote by $A_{i}$ the ordered $r$-tuple $\\left(a_{i}, \\ldots, a_{i+r-1}\\right)$; then among $A_{i}$ 's there are at most $r^{r}$ distinct tuples, so for every $k \\geqslant 0$ two of the tuples $A_{k}, A_{k+1}, \\ldots, A_{k+r^{r}}$ are identical. This means that there exists a positive integer $p \\leqslant r^{r}$ such that the equality $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$ holds infinitely many times. Let $D$ be the set of indices $d$ satisfying this relation.\n\nNow we claim that $D$ coincides with the set of all nonnegative integers. Since $D$ is unbounded, it suffices to show that $d \\in D$ whenever $d+1 \\in D$. For that, denote $b_{k}=S(k, p+k)$. The sequence $b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots$ satisfies the lemma conditions, so there exists an index $t \\in[d+1, d+r]$ such that $S(t, t+p)=S(d, d+p)$. This last relation rewrites as $S(d, t)=S(d+p, t+p)$. Since $A_{d+1}=A_{d+p+1}$, we have $S(d+1, t)=S(d+p+1, t+p)$, therefore we obtain\n\n$$\na_{d}=S(d, t)-S(d+1, t)=S(d+p, t+p)-S(d+p+1, t+p)=a_{d+p}\n$$\n\nand thus $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$, as required.\n\nFinally, we get $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$ for all $d$, so in particular $a_{d}=a_{d+p}$ for all $d$, QED."

Let $A=S_{1}(x)$. A subset $A^{\\prime}$ of $A$ is said to be substantial, if every city in $D$ can be reached from $x$ with four flights while passing through some member of $A^{\\prime}$; in other terms, every city in $D$ has distance 3 from some member of $A^{\\prime}$, or $D \\subseteq \\bigcup_{a \\in A^{\\prime}} S_{3}(a)$. For instance, $A$ itself is substantial. Now let us fix some substantial subset $A^{*}$ of $A$ having the minimal cardinality $m=\\left|A^{*}\\right|$.\n\nSince\n\n$$\nm(101-m) \\leqslant 50 \\cdot 51=2550\n$$\n\nthere has to be a city $a \\in A^{*}$ such that $\\left|S_{3}(a) \\cap D\\right| \\geqslant 102-m$.

Now, to get a contradiction, we will construct $m-1$ distinct elements in $T$, corresponding to $m-1$ elements of the set $A_{a}=A^{*} \\backslash\\{a\\}$.\n\nFirstly, due to the minimality of $A^{*}$, for each $y \\in A_{a}$ there exists some city $d_{y} \\in D$ which can only be reached with four flights from $x$ by passing through $y$. So, there is a way to get from $x$ to $d_{y}$ along $x-y-b_{y}-c_{y}-d_{y}$ for some cities $b_{y}$ and $c_{y}$; notice that $d\\left(x, b_{y}\\right)=2$ and $d\\left(x, c_{y}\\right)=3$ since this path has the minimal possible length.\n\nNow we claim that all $2(m-1)$ cities of the form $b_{y}, c_{y}$ with $y \\in A_{a}$ are distinct. Indeed, no $b_{y}$ may coincide with any $c_{z}$ since their distances from $x$ are different. On the other hand, if one had $b_{y}=b_{z}$ for $y \\neq z$, then there would exist a path of length 4 from $x$ to $d_{z}$ via $y$, namely $x-y-b_{z}-c_{z}-d_{z}$; this is impossible by the choice of $d_{z}$. Similarly, $c_{y} \\neq c_{z}$ for $y \\neq z$.\n\nSo, it suffices to prove that for every $y \\in A_{a}$, one of the cities $b_{y}$ and $c_{y}$ has distance 3 from $a$ (and thus belongs to $T$ ). For that, notice that $d(a, y) \\leqslant 2$ due to the path $a-x-y$, while $d\\left(a, d_{y}\\right) \\geqslant d\\left(x, d_{y}\\right)-d(x, a)=3$. Moreover, $d\\left(a, d_{y}\\right) \\neq 3$ by the choice of $d_{y}$; thus $d\\left(a, d_{y}\\right)>3$. Finally, in the sequence $d(a, y), d\\left(a, b_{y}\\right), d\\left(a, c_{y}\\right), d\\left(a, d_{y}\\right)$ the neighboring terms differ by at most 1 , the first term is less than 3 , and the last one is greater than 3 ; thus there exists one which is equal to 3 , as required."

            "Given a circular arrangement of $[0, n]=\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$, we define a $k$-chord to be a (possibly degenerate) chord whose (possibly equal) endpoints add up to $k$. We say that three chords of a circle are aligned if one of them separates the other two. Say that $m \\geqslant 3$ chords are aligned if any three of them are aligned. For instance, in Figure 1, $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned, while $B, C$, and $D$ are not.\n\n<img_4048>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3890>\n\nFigure 2\n\nClaim. In a beautiful arrangement, the $k$-chords are aligned for any integer $k$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. For $n \\leqslant 3$ the statement is trivial. Now let $n \\geqslant 4$, and proceed by contradiction. Consider a beautiful arrangement $S$ where the three $k$-chords $A, B, C$ are not aligned. If $n$ is not among the endpoints of $A, B$, and $C$, then by deleting $n$ from $S$ we obtain a beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{n\\}$ of $[0, n-1]$, where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned by the induction hypothesis. Similarly, if 0 is not among these endpoints, then deleting 0 and decreasing all the numbers by 1 gives a beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{0\\}$ where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned. Therefore both 0 and $n$ are among the endpoints of these segments. If $x$ and $y$ are their respective partners, we have $n \\geqslant 0+x=k=n+y \\geqslant n$. Thus 0 and $n$ are the endpoints of one of the chords; say it is $C$.\n\nLet $D$ be the chord formed by the numbers $u$ and $v$ which are adjacent to 0 and $n$ and on the same side of $C$ as $A$ and $B$, as shown in Figure 2. Set $t=u+v$. If we had $t=n$, the $n-$ chords $A$, $B$, and $D$ would not be aligned in the beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. If $t<n$, then the $t$-chord from 0 to $t$ cannot intersect $D$, so the chord $C$ separates $t$ and $D$. The chord $E$ from $t$ to $n-t$ does not intersect $C$, so $t$ and $n-t$ are on the same side of $C$. But then the chords $A, B$, and $E$ are not aligned in $S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}$, a contradiction. Finally, the case $t>n$ is equivalent to the case $t<n$ via the beauty-preserving relabelling $x \\mapsto n-x$ for $0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n$, which sends $t$-chords to $(2 n-t)$-chords. This proves the Claim.\n\nHaving established the Claim, we prove the desired result by induction. The case $n=2$ is trivial. Now assume that $n \\geqslant 3$. Let $S$ be a beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ and delete $n$ to obtain\n\n\n\nthe beautiful arrangement $T$ of $[0, n-1]$. The $n$-chords of $T$ are aligned, and they contain every point except 0 . Say $T$ is of Type 1 if 0 lies between two of these $n$-chords, and it is of Type 2 otherwise; i.e., if 0 is aligned with these $n$-chords. We will show that each Type 1 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from a unique arrangement of $[0, n]$, and each Type 2 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from exactly two beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.\n\nIf $T$ is of Type 1, let 0 lie between chords $A$ and $B$. Since the chord from 0 to $n$ must be aligned with $A$ and $B$ in $S, n$ must be on the other arc between $A$ and $B$. Therefore $S$ can be recovered uniquely from $T$. In the other direction, if $T$ is of Type 1 and we insert $n$ as above, then we claim the resulting arrangement $S$ is beautiful. For $0<k<n$, the $k$-chords of $S$ are also $k$-chords of $T$, so they are aligned. Finally, for $n<k<2 n$, notice that the $n$-chords of $S$ are parallel by construction, so there is an antisymmetry axis $\\ell$ such that $x$ is symmetric to $n-x$ with respect to $\\ell$ for all $x$. If we had two $k$-chords which intersect, then their reflections across $\\ell$ would be two $(2 n-k)$-chords which intersect, where $0<2 n-k<n$, a contradiction.\n\nIf $T$ is of Type 2, there are two possible positions for $n$ in $S$, on either side of 0 . As above, we check that both positions lead to beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.\n\nHence if we let $M_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$, and let $L_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ of Type 2 , we have\n\n$$\nM_{n}=\\left(M_{n-1}-L_{n-1}\\right)+2 L_{n-1}=M_{n-1}+L_{n-1} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nIt then remains to show that $L_{n-1}$ is the number of pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers with $x+y=n$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1$. Since $n \\geqslant 3$, this number equals $\\varphi(n)=\\#\\{x: 1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n, \\operatorname{gcd}(x, n)=1\\}$.\n\nTo prove this, consider a Type 2 beautiful arrangement of $[0, n-1]$. Label the positions $0, \\ldots, n-1(\\bmod n)$ clockwise around the circle, so that number 0 is in position 0 . Let $f(i)$ be the number in position $i$; note that $f$ is a permutation of $[0, n-1]$. Let $a$ be the position such that $f(a)=n-1$.\n\nSince the $n$-chords are aligned with 0 , and every point is in an $n$-chord, these chords are all parallel and\n\n$$\nf(i)+f(-i)=n \\quad \\text { for all } i\n$$\n\nSimilarly, since the $(n-1)$-chords are aligned and every point is in an $(n-1)$-chord, these chords are also parallel and\n\n$$\nf(i)+f(a-i)=n-1 \\quad \\text { for all } i \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTherefore $f(a-i)=f(-i)-1$ for all $i$; and since $f(0)=0$, we get\n\n$$\nf(-a k)=k \\quad \\text { for all } k \\text {. }\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nRecall that this is an equality modulo $n$. Since $f$ is a permutation, we must have $(a, n)=1$. Hence $L_{n-1} \\leqslant \\varphi(n)$.\n\nTo prove equality, it remains to observe that the labeling (1) is beautiful. To see this, consider four numbers $w, x, y, z$ on the circle with $w+y=x+z$. Their positions around the circle satisfy $(-a w)+(-a y)=(-a x)+(-a z)$, which means that the chord from $w$ to $y$ and the chord from $x$ to $z$ are parallel. Thus (1) is beautiful, and by construction it has Type 2. The desired result follows.",
            "Notice that there are exactly $N$ irreducible fractions $f_{1}<\\cdots<f_{N}$ in $(0,1)$ whose denominator is at most $n$, since the pair $(x, y)$ with $x+y \\leqslant n$ and $(x, y)=1$ corresponds to the fraction $x /(x+y)$. Write $f_{i}=\\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$.\n\nWe begin by constructing $N+1$ beautiful arrangements. Take any $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ which is not one of the above $N$ fractions. Consider a circle of perimeter 1 . Successively mark points $0,1,2, \\ldots, n$ where 0 is arbitrary, and the clockwise distance from $i$ to $i+1$ is $\\alpha$. The point $k$ will be at clockwise distance $\\{k \\alpha\\}$ from 0 , where $\\{r\\}$ denotes the fractional part of $r$. Call such a circular arrangement cyclic and denote it by $A(\\alpha)$. If the clockwise order of the points is the same in $A\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ and $A\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$, we regard them as the same circular arrangement. Figure 3 shows the cyclic arrangement $A(3 / 5+\\epsilon)$ of $[0,13]$ where $\\epsilon>0$ is very small.\n\n<img_3809>\n\nFigure 3\n\nIf $0 \\leqslant a, b, c, d \\leqslant n$ satisfy $a+c=b+d$, then $a \\alpha+c \\alpha=b \\alpha+d \\alpha$, so the chord from $a$ to $c$ is parallel to the chord from $b$ to $d$ in $A(\\alpha)$. Hence in a cyclic arrangement all $k$-chords are parallel. In particular every cyclic arrangement is beautiful.\n\nNext we show that there are exactly $N+1$ distinct cyclic arrangements. To see this, let us see how $A(\\alpha)$ changes as we increase $\\alpha$ from 0 to 1 . The order of points $p$ and $q$ changes precisely when we cross a value $\\alpha=f$ such that $\\{p f\\}=\\{q f\\}$; this can only happen if $f$ is one of the $N$ fractions $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{N}$. Therefore there are at most $N+1$ different cyclic arrangements.\n\nTo show they are all distinct, recall that $f_{i}=a_{i} / b_{i}$ and let $\\epsilon>0$ be a very small number. In the arrangement $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$, point $k$ lands at $\\frac{k a_{i}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)}{b_{i}}+k \\epsilon$. Therefore the points are grouped into $b_{i}$ clusters next to the points $0, \\frac{1}{b_{i}}, \\ldots, \\frac{b_{i}-1}{b_{i}}$ of the circle. The cluster following $\\frac{k}{b_{i}}$ contains the numbers congruent to $k a_{i}^{-1}$ modulo $b_{i}$, listed clockwise in increasing order. It follows that the first number after 0 in $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$ is $b_{i}$, and the first number after 0 which is less than $b_{i}$ is $a_{i}^{-1}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)$, which uniquely determines $a_{i}$. In this way we can recover $f_{i}$ from the cyclic arrangement. Note also that $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$ is not the trivial arrangement where we list $0,1, \\ldots, n$ in order clockwise. It follows that the $N+1$ cyclic arrangements $A(\\epsilon), A\\left(f_{1}+\\epsilon\\right), \\ldots, A\\left(f_{N}+\\epsilon\\right)$ are distinct.\n\nLet us record an observation which will be useful later:\n\n$$\n\\text { if } f_{i}<\\alpha<f_{i+1} \\text { then } 0 \\text { is immediately after } b_{i+1} \\text { and before } b_{i} \\text { in } A(\\alpha) \\text {. }\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIndeed, we already observed that $b_{i}$ is the first number after 0 in $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)$. Similarly we see that $b_{i+1}$ is the last number before 0 in $A\\left(f_{i+1}-\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)$.\n\n\n\nFinally, we show that any beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ is cyclic by induction on $n$. For $n \\leqslant 2$ the result is clear. Now assume that all beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ are cyclic, and consider a beautiful arrangement $A$ of $[0, n]$. The subarrangement $A_{n-1}=A \\backslash\\{n\\}$ of $[0, n-1]$ obtained by deleting $n$ is cyclic; say $A_{n-1}=A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be between the consecutive fractions $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$ among the irreducible fractions of denominator at most $n-1$. There is at most one fraction $\\frac{i}{n}$ in $\\left(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}, \\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\right)$, since $\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{i}{n-1} \\leqslant \\frac{i+1}{n}$ for $0<i \\leqslant n-1$.\n\nCase 1. There is no fraction with denominator $n$ between $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}$ and $\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$.\n\nIn this case the only cyclic arrangement extending $A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$ is $A_{n}(\\alpha)$. We know that $A$ and $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ can only differ in the position of $n$. Assume $n$ is immediately after $x$ and before $y$ in $A_{n}(\\alpha)$. Since the neighbors of 0 are $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ by (2), we have $x, y \\geqslant 1$.\n\n<img_3352>\n\nFigure 4\n\nIn $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ the chord from $n-1$ to $x$ is parallel and adjacent to the chord from $n$ to $x-1$, so $n-1$ is between $x-1$ and $x$ in clockwise order, as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, $n-1$ is between $y$ and $y-1$. Therefore $x, y, x-1, n-1$, and $y-1$ occur in this order in $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ and hence in $A$ (possibly with $y=x-1$ or $x=y-1$ ).\n\nNow, $A$ may only differ from $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ in the location of $n$. In $A$, since the chord from $n-1$ to $x$ and the chord from $n$ to $x-1$ do not intersect, $n$ is between $x$ and $n-1$. Similarly, $n$ is between $n-1$ and $y$. Then $n$ must be between $x$ and $y$ and $A=A_{n}(\\alpha)$. Therefore $A$ is cyclic as desired.\n\nCase 2. There is exactly one $i$ with $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$.\n\nIn this case there exist two cyclic arrangements $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ and $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$ of the numbers $0, \\ldots, n$ extending $A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$, where $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\alpha_{1}<\\frac{i}{n}$ and $\\frac{i}{n}<\\alpha_{2}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$. In $A_{n-1}(\\alpha), 0$ is the only number between $q_{2}$ and $q_{1}$ by (2).

        "question": "Players $A$ and $B$ play a paintful game on the real line. Player $A$ has a pot of paint with four units of black ink. A quantity $p$ of this ink suffices to blacken a (closed) real interval of length $p$. In every round, player $A$ picks some positive integer $m$ and provides $1 / 2^{m}$ units of ink from the pot. Player $B$ then picks an integer $k$ and blackens the interval from $k / 2^{m}$ to $(k+1) / 2^{m}$ (some parts of this interval may have been blackened before). The goal of player $A$ is to reach a situation where the pot is empty and the interval $[0,1]$ is not completely blackened.\n\nProve that there doesn't exist a strategy for player $A$ to win in a finite number of moves.",
        "solution": [
            "We will present a strategy for player $B$ that guarantees that the interval $[0,1]$ is completely blackened, once the paint pot has become empty.\n\nAt the beginning of round $r$, let $x_{r}$ denote the largest real number for which the interval between 0 and $x_{r}$ has already been blackened; for completeness we define $x_{1}=0$. Let $m$ be the integer picked by player $A$ in this round; we define an integer $y_{r}$ by\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{r}}{2^{m}} \\leqslant x_{r}<\\frac{y_{r}+1}{2^{m}}\n$$\n\nNote that $I_{0}^{r}=\\left[y_{r} / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]$ is the leftmost interval that may be painted in round $r$ and that still contains some uncolored point.\n\nPlayer $B$ now looks at the next interval $I_{1}^{r}=\\left[\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+2\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]$. If $I_{1}^{r}$ still contains an uncolored point, then player $B$ blackens the interval $I_{1}^{r}$; otherwise he blackens the interval $I_{0}^{r}$. We make the convention that, at the beginning of the game, the interval $[1,2]$ is already blackened; thus, if $y_{r}+1=2^{m}$, then $B$ blackens $I_{0}^{r}$.\n\nOur aim is to estimate the amount of ink used after each round. Firstly, we will prove by induction that, if before $r$ th round the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely colored, then, before this move,\n\n(i) the amount of ink used for the segment $\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]$ is at most $3 x_{r}$; and\n\n(ii) for every $m, B$ has blackened at most one interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$.\n\nObviously, these conditions are satisfied for $r=0$. Now assume that they were satisfied before the $r$ th move, and consider the situation after this move; let $m$ be the number $A$ has picked at this move.\n\nIf $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{1}^{r}$ at this move, then $x_{r+1}=x_{r}$, and $(i)$ holds by the induction hypothesis. Next, had $B$ blackened before the $r$ th move any interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$, this interval would necessarily coincide with $I_{1}^{r}$. By our strategy, this cannot happen. So, condition (ii) also remains valid.\n\nAssume now that $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{0}^{r}$ at the $r$ th move, but the interval $[0,1]$ still contains uncolored parts (which means that $I_{1}^{r}$ is contained in $[0,1]$ ). Then condition (ii) clearly remains true, and we need to check $(i)$ only. In our case, the intervals $I_{0}^{r}$ and $I_{1}^{r}$ are completely colored after the $r$ th move, so $x_{r+1}$ either reaches the right endpoint of $I_{1}$ or moves even further to the right. So, $x_{r+1}=x_{r}+\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha>1 / 2^{m}$.\n\nNext, any interval blackened by $B$ before the $r$ th move which intersects $\\left(x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right)$ should be contained in $\\left[x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right]$; by (ii), all such intervals have different lengths not exceeding $1 / 2^{m}$, so the total amount of ink used for them is less than $2 / 2^{m}$. Thus, the amount of ink used for the segment $\\left[0, x_{r+1}\\right]$ does not exceed the sum of $2 / 2^{m}, 3 x_{r}$ (used for $\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]$ ), and $1 / 2^{m}$ used for the\n\n\n\nsegment $I_{0}^{r}$. In total it gives at most $3\\left(x_{r}+1 / 2^{m}\\right)<3\\left(x_{r}+\\alpha\\right)=3 x_{r+1}$. Thus condition $(i)$ is also verified in this case. The claim is proved.\n\nFinally, we can perform the desired estimation. Consider any situation in the game, say after the $(r-1)$ st move; assume that the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely black. By $(i i)$, in the segment $\\left[x_{r}, 1\\right]$ player $B$ has colored several segments of different lengths; all these lengths are negative powers of 2 not exceeding $1-x_{r}$; thus the total amount of ink used for this interval is at most $2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)$. Using $(i)$, we obtain that the total amount of ink used is at most $3 x_{r}+2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)<3$. Thus the pot is not empty, and therefore $A$ never wins."

Otherwise, we must have\n\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{A B}+\\overrightarrow{C D}+\\overrightarrow{E F}=\\overrightarrow{0}\n$$\n\nor else we would have two vectors with different directions whose sum is $\\overrightarrow{0}$.\n\n<img_3570>\n\nThis allows us to consider a triangle $L M N$ with $\\overrightarrow{L M}=\\overrightarrow{E F}, \\overrightarrow{M N}=\\overrightarrow{A B}$, and $\\overrightarrow{N L}=\\overrightarrow{C D}$.

Since $F O_{3}$ and $A O_{1}$ are translations of $M O$, quadrilateral $A F O_{3} O_{1}$ is a parallelogram and $O_{3} O_{1}=F A=C D=N L$. Similarly, $O_{1} O_{2}=L M$ and $O_{2} O_{3}=M N$. Therefore $\\triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3} \\cong \\triangle L M N$. Moreover, by means of the rotation $R$ one may check that these triangles have the same orientation.\n\nLet $T$ be the circumcenter of $\\triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3}$. We claim that $A D, B E$, and $C F$ meet at $T$. Let us show that $C, T$, and $F$ are collinear. Notice that $C O_{2}=O_{2} T=T O_{3}=O_{3} F$ since they are all equal to the circumradius of $\\triangle L M N$. Therefore $\\triangle T O_{3} F$ and $\\triangle C_{2} T$ are isosceles.

Analogous arguments show that it is on $A D$ and $B E$ also. The desired result follows.",
            "we denote $\\theta=\\angle A-\\angle D=\\angle C-\\angle F=\\angle E-\\angle B$ and assume without loss of generality that $\\theta \\geqslant 0$.\n\nPlace the hexagon on the complex plane, with $A$ at the origin and vertices labelled clockwise.

Also consider the complex numbers $a, b, c, a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}$ given by $B-A=a, D-C=b, F-E=c, E-D=a^{\\prime}$, $A-F=b^{\\prime}$, and $C-B=c^{\\prime}$. Let $k=|a| /|b|$.

            "Denote the circumcircles of the triangles $A B C$ and $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ by $\\Omega$ and $\\Gamma$, respectively. Denote the midpoint of the $\\operatorname{arc} C B$ of $\\Omega$ containing $A$ by $A_{0}$, and define $B_{0}$ as well as $C_{0}$ analogously. By our hypothesis the centre $Q$ of $\\Gamma$ lies on $\\Omega$.\n\nLemma. One has $A_{0} B_{1}=A_{0} C_{1}$. Moreover, the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are concyclic. Finally, the points $A$ and $A_{0}$ lie on the same side of $B_{1} C_{1}$. Similar statements hold for $B$ and $C$.\n\nProof. Let us consider the case $A=A_{0}$ first. Then the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $A$, which implies $A B_{1}=A C_{1}$ while the remaining assertions of the Lemma are obvious. So let us suppose $A \\neq A_{0}$ from now on.\n\nBy the definition of $A_{0}$, we have $A_{0} B=A_{0} C$. It is also well known and easy to show that $B C_{1}=$ $C B_{1}$. Next, we have $\\angle C_{1} B A_{0}=\\angle A B A_{0}=\\angle A C A_{0}=\\angle B_{1} C A_{0}$. Hence the triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$ are congruent. This implies $A_{0} C_{1}=A_{0} B_{1}$, establishing the first part of the Lemma. It also follows that $\\angle A_{0} C_{1} A=\\angle A_{0} B_{1} A$, as these are exterior angles at the corresponding vertices $C_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ of the congruent triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$. For that reason the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are indeed the vertices of some cyclic quadrilateral two opposite sides of which are $A A_{0}$ and $B_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nNow we turn to the solution. Evidently the points $A_{1}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ lie interior to some semicircle arc of $\\Gamma$, so the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is obtuse-angled. Without loss of generality, we will assume that its angle at $B_{1}$ is obtuse. Thus $Q$ and $B_{1}$ lie on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$; obviously, the same holds for the points $B$ and $B_{1}$. So, the points $Q$ and $B$ are on the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nNotice that the perpendicular bisector of $A_{1} C_{1}$ intersects $\\Omega$ at two points lying on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$. By the first statement from the Lemma, both points $B_{0}$ and $Q$ are among these points of intersection; since they share the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$, they coincide (see Figure 1).\n\n<img_3398>\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nNow, by the first part of the Lemma again, the lines $Q A_{0}$ and $Q C_{0}$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A_{1} B_{1}$, respectively. Thus\n\n$$\n\\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\\angle C_{1} B_{0} B_{1}+\\angle B_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=2 \\angle A_{0} B_{0} B_{1}+2 \\angle B_{1} B_{0} C_{0}=2 \\angle A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A B C,\n$$\n\nrecalling that $A_{0}$ and $C_{0}$ are the midpoints of the $\\operatorname{arcs} C B$ and $B A$, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, by the second part of the Lemma we have\n\n$$\n\\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\\angle C_{1} B A_{1}=\\angle A B C .\n$$\n\nFrom the last two equalities, we get $\\angle A B C=90^{\\circ}$, whereby the problem is solved.",
            "Let $Q$ again denote the centre of the circumcircle of the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$, that lies on the circumcircle $\\Omega$ of the triangle $A B C$. We first consider the case where $Q$ coincides with one of the vertices of $A B C$, say $Q=B$. Then $B C_{1}=B A_{1}$ and consequently the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $B$. Moreover we have $B C_{1}=B_{1} C$ in any triangle, and hence $B B_{1}=B C_{1}=B_{1} C$; similarly, $B B_{1}=B_{1} A$. It follows that $B_{1}$ is the centre of $\\Omega$ and that the triangle $A B C$ has a right angle at $B$.\n\nSo from now on we may suppose $Q \\notin\\{A, B, C\\}$. We start with the following well known fact. Lemma. Let $X Y Z$ and $X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ be two triangles with $X Y=X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}$ and $Y Z=Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$.\n\n(i) If $X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and $\\angle Y Z X=\\angle Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}$, then $\\angle Z X Y+\\angle Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}$.\n\n(ii) If $\\angle Y Z X+\\angle X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}$, then $\\angle Z X Y=\\angle Y^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. For both parts, we may move the triangle $X Y Z$ through the plane until $Y=Y^{\\prime}$ and $Z=Z^{\\prime}$. Possibly after reflecting one of the two triangles about $Y Z$, we may also suppose that $X$ and $X^{\\prime}$ lie on the same side of $Y Z$ if we are in case $(i)$ and on different sides if we are in case (ii). In both cases, the points $X, Z$, and $X^{\\prime}$ are collinear due to the angle condition (see Fig. 2). Moreover we have $X \\neq X^{\\prime}$, because in case $(i)$ we assumed $X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and in case $(i i)$ these points even lie on different sides of $Y Z$. Thus the triangle $X X^{\\prime} Y$ is isosceles at $Y$. The claim now follows by considering the equal angles at its base.\n\n<img_3275>\n\nFigure $2(i)$\n\n<img_3630>\n\nFigure $2($ ii $)$\n\nRelabeling the vertices of the triangle $A B C$ if necessary we may suppose that $Q$ lies in the interior of the arc $A B$ of $\\Omega$ not containing $C$. We will sometimes use tacitly that the six triangles $Q B A_{1}, Q A_{1} C, Q C B_{1}, Q B_{1} A, Q C_{1} A$, and $Q B C_{1}$ have the same orientation.\n\nAs $Q$ cannot be the circumcentre of the triangle $A B C$, it is impossible that $Q A=Q B=Q C$ and thus we may also suppose that $Q C \\neq Q B$. Now the above Lemma $(i)$ is applicable to the triangles $Q B_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} B$, since $Q B_{1}=Q C_{1}$ and $B_{1} C=C_{1} B$, while $\\angle B_{1} C Q=\\angle C_{1} B Q$ holds as both angles appear over the same side of the chord $Q A$ in $\\Omega$ (see Fig. 3). So we get\n\n$$\n\\angle C Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n\n\nWe claim that $Q C=Q A$. To see this, let us assume for the sake of a contradiction that $Q C \\neq Q A$. Then arguing similarly as before but now with the triangles $Q A_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} A$ we get\n\n$$\n\\angle A_{1} Q C+\\angle C_{1} Q A=180^{\\circ} .\n$$\n\nAdding this equation to (1), we get $\\angle A_{1} Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q A=360^{\\circ}$, which is absurd as both summands lie in the interval $\\left(0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}\\right)$.\n\nThis proves $Q C=Q A$; so the triangles $Q A_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} A$ are congruent their sides being equal, which in turn yields\n\n$$\n\\angle A_{1} Q C=\\angle C_{1} Q A .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nFinally our Lemma ( $i i$ i) is applicable to the triangles $Q A_{1} B$ and $Q B_{1} A$. Indeed we have $Q A_{1}=Q B_{1}$ and $A_{1} B=B_{1} A$ as usual, and the angle condition $\\angle A_{1} B Q+\\angle Q A B_{1}=180^{\\circ}$ holds as $A$ and $B$ lie on different sides of the chord $Q C$ in $\\Omega$. Consequently we have\n\n$$\n\\angle B Q A_{1}=\\angle B_{1} Q A .\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nFrom (1) and (3) we get\n\n$$\n\\left(\\angle B_{1} Q C+\\angle B_{1} Q A\\right)+\\left(\\angle C_{1} Q B-\\angle B Q A_{1}\\right)=180^{\\circ},\n$$\n\ni.e. $\\angle C Q A+\\angle A_{1} Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}$. In light of (2) this may be rewritten as $2 \\angle C Q A=180^{\\circ}$ and as $Q$ lies on $\\Omega$ this implies that the triangle $A B C$ has a right angle at $B$.\n\n<img_3157>\n\nFigure 3"

The last inequality is clearly false for sufficiently large values of $k$. This contradiction shows that $2 \\gamma_{n} \\geqslant n$ for all $n>N$.\n\nII.

In view of (2), this means that the other one is divisible by either $5^{k}$ or by $2^{k-1}$. Notice also that $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ have the same parity, so both are even.\n\nOn the other hand, we have $x_{k+1}^{2}=x_{k}^{2}+10^{k} a_{k+1} \\geqslant x_{k}^{2}+10^{k}>2 x_{k}^{2}$, so $x_{k+1} / x_{k}>\\sqrt{2}$, which implies that\n\n$$\n1<\\frac{q_{k}}{p_{k}}=1+\\frac{2}{x_{k+1} / x_{k}-1}<1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}-1}<6\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nThus, if one of the numbers $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ is divisible by $5^{k}$, then we have\n\n$$\n10^{k+1}>10^{k} a_{k+1}=p_{k} q_{k} \\geqslant \\frac{\\left(5^{k}\\right)^{2}}{6}\n$$\n\nand hence $(5 / 2)^{k}<60$ which is false for sufficiently large $k$.

This, together with (7), shows that the sth digit from the right in $y_{k+1}$, which is $a_{s}$, is zero. This contradicts the problem condition."

        "question": "Fix an integer $k \\geqslant 2$. Two players, called Ana and Banana, play the following game of numbers: Initially, some integer $n \\geqslant k$ gets written on the blackboard. Then they take moves in turn, with Ana beginning. A player making a move erases the number $m$ just written on the blackboard and replaces it by some number $m^{\\prime}$ with $k \\leqslant m^{\\prime}<m$ that is coprime to $m$. The first player who cannot move anymore loses.\n\nAn integer $n \\geqslant k$ is called good if Banana has a winning strategy when the initial number is $n$, and bad otherwise.\n\nConsider two integers $n, n^{\\prime} \\geqslant k$ with the property that each prime number $p \\leqslant k$ divides $n$ if and only if it divides $n^{\\prime}$. Prove that either both $n$ and $n^{\\prime}$ are good or both are bad.",
        "solution": [
            "Let us first observe that the number appearing on the blackboard decreases after every move; so the game necessarily ends after at most $n$ steps, and consequently there always has to be some player possessing a winning strategy. So if some $n \\geqslant k$ is bad, then Ana has a winning strategy in the game with starting number $n$.\n\nMore precisely, if $n \\geqslant k$ is such that there is a good integer $m$ with $n>m \\geqslant k$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$, then $n$ itself is bad, for Ana has the following winning strategy in the game with initial number $n$ : She proceeds by first playing $m$ and then using Banana's strategy for the game with starting number $m$.\n\nOtherwise, if some integer $n \\geqslant k$ has the property that every integer $m$ with $n>m \\geqslant k$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$ is bad, then $n$ is good. Indeed, if Ana can make a first move at all in the game with initial number $n$, then she leaves it in a position where the first player has a winning strategy, so that Banana can defeat her.\n\nIn particular, this implies that any two good numbers have a non-trivial common divisor. Also, $k$ itself is good.\n\nFor brevity, we say that $n \\longrightarrow x$ is a move if $n$ and $x$ are two coprime integers with $n>x \\geqslant k$.\n\nClaim 1. If $n$ is good and $n^{\\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$, then $n^{\\prime}$ is also good.\n\nProof. If $n^{\\prime}$ were bad, there would have to be some move $n^{\\prime} \\longrightarrow x$, where $x$ is good. As $n^{\\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$ this implies that the two good numbers $n$ and $x$ are coprime, which is absurd.\n\nClaim 2. If $r$ and $s$ denote two positive integers for which $r s \\geqslant k$ is bad, then $r^{2} s$ is also bad. Proof. Since $r s$ is bad, there is a move $r s \\longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Evidently $x$ is coprime to $r^{2} s$ as well, and hence the move $r^{2} s \\longrightarrow x$ shows that $r^{2} s$ is indeed bad.\n\nClaim 3. If $p>k$ is prime and $n \\geqslant k$ is bad, then $n p$ is also bad.\n\nProof. Otherwise we choose a counterexample with $n$ being as small as possible. In particular, $n p$ is good. Since $n$ is bad, there is a move $n \\longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Now $n p \\longrightarrow x$ cannot be a valid move, which tells us that $x$ has to be divisible by $p$. So we can write $x=p^{r} y$, where $r$ and $y$ denote some positive integers, the latter of which is not divisible by $p$.\n\nNote that $y=1$ is impossible, for then we would have $x=p^{r}$ and the move $x \\longrightarrow k$ would establish that $x$ is bad. In view of this, there is a least power $y^{\\alpha}$ of $y$ that is at least as large as $k$. Since the numbers $n p$ and $y^{\\alpha}$ are coprime and the former is good, the latter has to be bad. Moreover, the minimality of $\\alpha$ implies $y^{\\alpha}<k y<p y=\\frac{x}{p^{r-1}}<\\frac{n}{p^{r-1}}$. So $p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}<n$ and consequently all the numbers $y^{\\alpha}, p y^{\\alpha}, \\ldots, p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}=p\\left(p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}\\right)$ are bad due to the minimal choice of $n$. But now by Claim 1 the divisor $x$ of $p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}$ cannot be good, whereby we have reached a contradiction that proves Claim 3.\n\n\n\nWe now deduce the statement of the problem from these three claims. To this end, we call two integers $a, b \\geqslant k$ similar if they are divisible by the same prime numbers not exceeding $k$. We are to prove that if $a$ and $b$ are similar, then either both of them are good or both are bad. As in this case the product $a b$ is similar to both $a$ and $b$, it suffices to show the following: if $c \\geqslant k$ is similar to some of its multiples $d$, then either both $c$ and $d$ are good or both are bad.\n\nAssuming that this is not true in general, we choose a counterexample $\\left(c_{0}, d_{0}\\right)$ with $d_{0}$ being as small as possible. By Claim 1, $c_{0}$ is bad whilst $d_{0}$ is good. Plainly $d_{0}$ is strictly greater than $c_{0}$ and hence the quotient $\\frac{d_{0}}{c_{0}}$ has some prime factor $p$. Clearly $p$ divides $d_{0}$. If $p \\leqslant k$, then $p$ divides $c_{0}$ as well due to the similarity, and hence $d_{0}$ is actually divisible by $p^{2}$. So $\\frac{d_{0}}{p}$ is good by the contrapositive of Claim 2. Since $c_{0} \\mid \\frac{d_{0}}{p}$, the pair $\\left(c_{0}, \\frac{d_{0}}{p}\\right)$ contradicts the supposed minimality of $d_{0}$. This proves $p>k$, but now we get the same contradiction using Claim 3 instead of Claim 2. Thereby the problem is solved.",
            "We use the same analysis of the game of numbers as in the first five paragraphs of the first solution. Let us call a prime number $p$ small in case $p \\leqslant k$ and big otherwise. We again call two integers similar if their sets of small prime factors coincide.\n\nClaim 4. For each integer $b \\geqslant k$ having some small prime factor, there exists an integer $x$ similar to it with $b \\geqslant x \\geqslant k$ and having no big prime factors.\n\nProof. Unless $b$ has a big prime factor we may simply choose $x=b$. Now let $p$ and $q$ denote a small and a big prime factor of $b$, respectively. Let $a$ be the product of all small prime factors of $b$. Further define $n$ to be the least non-negative integer for which the number $x=p^{n} a$ is at least as large as $k$. It suffices to show that $b>x$. This is clear in case $n=0$, so let us assume $n>0$ from now on. Then we have $x<p k$ due to the minimality of $n, p \\leqslant a$ because $p$ divides $a$ by construction, and $k<q$. Therefore $x<a q$ and, as the right hand side is a product of distinct prime factors of $b$, this implies indeed $x<b$.\n\nLet us now assume that there is a pair $(a, b)$ of similar numbers such that $a$ is bad and $b$ is good. Take such a pair with $\\max (a, b)$ being as small as possible. Since $a$ is bad, there exists a move $a \\longrightarrow r$ for some good $r$. Since the numbers $k$ and $r$ are both good, they have a common prime factor, which necessarily has to be small. Thus Claim 4 is applicable to $r$, which yields an integer $r^{\\prime}$ similar to $r$ containing small prime factors only and satisfying $r \\geqslant r^{\\prime} \\geqslant k$. Since $\\max \\left(r, r^{\\prime}\\right)=r<a \\leqslant \\max (a, b)$ the number $r^{\\prime}$ is also good. Now let $p$ denote a common prime factor of the good numbers $r^{\\prime}$ and $b$. By our construction of $r^{\\prime}$, this prime is small and due to the similarities it consequently divides $a$ and $r$, contrary to $a \\longrightarrow r$ being a move. Thereby the problem is solved."

If $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\}<1$, then we have $\\lfloor(a+b) \\nu\\rfloor=\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor$ and $\\lceil(a+b) \\nu\\rceil=\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-1$, so\n\n$$\nf(a+b, b)=(a+b)\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-b(\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf(a, b+a)=a(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1)-(b+a)\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor=f(a, b)+a(\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1-\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b) .\n$$\n\nSimilarly, if $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\} \\geqslant 1$ then one obtains\n\n$$\nf(a+b, b)=f(a, b) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)+a\n$$\n\nSo, in both cases one of the numbers $f(a+b, a)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ is equal to $f(a, b)$ while the other is greater than $f(a, b)$ by one of $a$ and $b$. Thus, exactly one of the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ is excellent (for an appropriate value of $m$ ).\n\nNow let us say that the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are the children of the pair $(a, b)$, while this pair is their parent. Next, if a pair $(c, d)$ can be obtained from $(a, b)$ by several passings from a parent to a child, we will say that $(c, d)$ is a descendant of $(a, b)$, while $(a, b)$ is an ancestor of $(c, d)$ (a pair is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of itself). Thus each pair $(a, b)$ has two children, it has a unique parent if $a \\neq b$, and no parents otherwise. Therefore, each pair of distinct positive integers has a unique ancestor of the form $(a, a)$; our aim is now to find how many $m$-excellent descendants each such pair has.\n\nNotice now that if a pair $(a, b)$ is $m$-excellent then $\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m$. Indeed, if $a=b$ then $f(a, a)=a=m$, so the statement is valid. Otherwise, the pair $(a, b)$ is a child of some pair $\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)$. If $b=b^{\\prime}$ and $a=a^{\\prime}+b^{\\prime}$, then we should have $m=f(a, b)=f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)+b^{\\prime}$, so $b=b^{\\prime}=m-f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)<m$. Similarly, if $a=a^{\\prime}$ and $b=b^{\\prime}+a^{\\prime}$ then $a<m$.\n\nLet us consider the set $S_{m}$ of all pairs $(a, b)$ such that $f(a, b) \\leqslant m$ and $\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m$. Then all the ancestors of the elements in $S_{m}$ are again in $S_{m}$, and each element in $S_{m}$ either is of the form $(a, a)$ with $a \\leqslant m$, or has a unique ancestor of this form. From the arguments above we see that all $m$-excellent pairs lie in $S_{m}$.\n\nWe claim now that the set $S_{m}$ is finite. Indeed, assume, for instance, that it contains infinitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $d>2 m$. Such a pair is necessarily a child of $(c, d-c)$, and thus a descendant of some pair $\\left(c, d^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $m<d^{\\prime} \\leqslant 2 m$. Therefore, one of the pairs $(a, b) \\in S_{m}$ with $m<b \\leqslant 2 m$\n\n\n\nhas infinitely many descendants in $S_{m}$, and all these descendants have the form $(a, b+k a)$ with $k$ a positive integer. Since $f(a, b+k a)$ does not decrease as $k$ grows, it becomes constant for $k \\geqslant k_{0}$, where $k_{0}$ is some positive integer. This means that $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}<1$ for all $k \\geqslant k_{0}$. But this yields $1>\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}=\\left\\{\\left(b+k_{0} a\\right) \\nu\\right\\}+\\left(k-k_{0}\\right)\\{a \\nu\\}$ for all $k>k_{0}$, which is absurd.\n\nSimilarly, one can prove that $S_{m}$ contains finitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $c>2 m$, thus finitely many elements at all.\n\nWe are now prepared for proving the following crucial lemma.\n\nLemma. Consider any pair $(a, b)$ with $f(a, b) \\neq m$. Then the number $g(a, b)$ of its $m$-excellent descendants is equal to the number $h(a, b)$ of ways to represent the number $t=m-f(a, b)$ as $t=k a+\\ell b$ with $k$ and $\\ell$ being some nonnegative integers.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction on the number $N$ of descendants of $(a, b)$ in $S_{m}$. If $N=0$ then clearly $g(a, b)=0$. Assume that $h(a, b)>0$; without loss of generality, we have $a \\leqslant b$. Then, clearly, $m-f(a, b) \\geqslant a$, so $f(a, b+a) \\leqslant f(a, b)+a \\leqslant m$ and $a \\leqslant m$, hence $(a, b+a) \\in S_{m}$ which is impossible. Thus in the base case we have $g(a, b)=h(a, b)=0$, as desired.\n\nNow let $N>0$. Assume that $f(a+b, b)=f(a, b)+b$ and $f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)$ (the other case is similar). If $f(a, b)+b \\neq m$, then by the induction hypothesis we have\n\n$$\ng(a, b)=g(a+b, b)+g(a, b+a)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)\n$$\n\nNotice that both pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are descendants of $(a, b)$ and thus each of them has strictly less descendants in $S_{m}$ than $(a, b)$ does.\n\nNext, each one of the $h(a+b, b)$ representations of $m-f(a+b, b)=m-b-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\\prime}(a+b)+\\ell^{\\prime} b$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b$ with $k=k^{\\prime}<k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime}+1=\\ell$. Similarly, each one of the $h(a, b+a)$ representations of $m-f(a, b+a)=m-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\\prime} a+\\ell^{\\prime}(b+a)$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b$ with $k=k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime} \\geqslant \\ell^{\\prime}=\\ell$. This correspondence is obviously bijective, so\n\n$$\nh(a, b)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)=g(a, b)\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nFinally, if $f(a, b)+b=m$ then $(a+b, b)$ is $m$-excellent, so $g(a, b)=1+g(a, b+a)=1+h(a, b+a)$ by the induction hypothesis. On the other hand, the number $m-f(a, b)=b$ has a representation $0 \\cdot a+1 \\cdot b$ and sometimes one more representation as $k a+0 \\cdot b$; this last representation exists simultaneously with the representation $m-f(a, b+a)=k a+0 \\cdot(b+a)$, so $h(a, b)=1+h(a, b+a)$ as well. Thus in this case the step is also proved.\n\nNow it is easy to finish the solution. There exists a unique $m$-excellent pair of the form $(a, a)$, and each other $m$-excellent pair $(a, b)$ has a unique ancestor of the form $(x, x)$ with $x<m$. By the lemma, for every $x<m$ the number of its $m$-excellent descendants is $h(x, x)$, which is the number of ways to represent $m-f(x, x)=m-x$ as $k x+\\ell x$ (with nonnegative integer $k$ and $\\ell$ ). This number is 0 if $x \\not m$, and $m / x$ otherwise. So the total number of excellent pairs is\n\n$$\n1+\\sum_{x \\mid m, x<m} \\frac{m}{x}=1+\\sum_{d \\mid m, d>1} d=\\sum_{d \\mid m} d\n$$\n\nas required."

For any real $t$, substituting $(x, y)=\\left(0, \\frac{t}{f(0)}\\right)$ into the given functional equation, we obtain\n\n$$\nf(0)=f(t)\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\ncontradicting the fact that $f$ is not a constant function. Therefore, $f(0)=0$. Next for any $t$, substituting $(x, y)=(t, 0)$ and $(x, y)=(t,-t)$ into the given equation, we get\n\n$$\nf(t f(t))=f(0)+t^{2}=t^{2},\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf(t f(0))=f(-t f(t))+t^{2}\n$$\n\nrespectively. Therefore, we conclude that\n\n$$\nf(t f(t))=t^{2}, \\quad f(-t f(t))=-t^{2}, \\quad \\text { for every real } t\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nConsequently, for every real $v$, there exists a real $u$, such that $f(u)=v$. We also see that if $f(t)=0$, then $0=f(t f(t))=t^{2}$ so that $t=0$, and thus 0 is the only real number satisfying $f(t)=0$.\n\nWe next show that for any real number $s$,\n\n$$\nf(-s)=-f(s) \\text {. }\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nThis is clear if $f(s)=0$. Suppose now $f(s)<0$, then we can find a number $t$ for which $f(s)=-t^{2}$. As $t \\neq 0$ implies $f(t) \\neq 0$, we can also find number $a$ such that $a f(t)=s$. Substituting $(x, y)=(t, a)$ into the given equation, we get\n\n$$\nf(t f(t+a))=f(a f(t))+t^{2}=f(s)+t^{2}=0\n$$\n\nand therefore, $t f(t+a)=0$, which implies $t+a=0$, and hence $s=-t f(t)$. Consequently, $f(-s)=f(t f(t))=t^{2}=-\\left(-t^{2}\\right)=-f(s)$ holds in this case.\n\nFinally, suppose $f(s)>0$ holds. Then there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ for which $f(s)=t^{2}$. Choose a number $a$ such that $t f(a)=s$. Substituting $(x, y)=(t, a-t)$ into the given equation, we get $f(s)=f(t f(a))=f((a-t) f(t))+t^{2}=f((a-t) f(t))+f(s)$. So we have $f((a-t) f(t))=0$, from which we conclude that $(a-t) f(t)=0$. Since $f(t) \\neq 0$, we get $a=t$ so that $s=t f(t)$ and thus we see $f(-s)=f(-t f(t))=-t^{2}=-f(s)$ holds in this case also. This observation finishes the proof of (3).\n\nBy substituting $(x, y)=(s, t),(x, y)=(t,-s-t)$ and $(x, y)=(-s-t, s)$ into the given equation,\n\n\n\nwe obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nf(s f(s+t)))=f(t f(s))+s^{2} \\\\\nf(t f(-s))=f((-s-t) f(t))+t^{2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf((-s-t) f(-t))=f(s f(-s-t))+(s+t)^{2},\n$$\n\nrespectively. Using the fact that $f(-x)=-f(x)$ holds for all $x$ to rewrite the second and the third equation, and rearranging the terms, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(t f(s))-f(s f(s+t)) & =-s^{2} \\\\\nf(t f(s))-f((s+t) f(t)) & =-t^{2} \\\\\nf((s+t) f(t))+f(s f(s+t)) & =(s+t)^{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding up these three equations now yields $2 f(t f(s))=2 t s$, and therefore, we conclude that $f(t f(s))=t s$ holds for every pair of real numbers $s, t$. By fixing $s$ so that $f(s)=1$, we obtain $f(x)=s x$. In view of the given equation, we see that $s= \\pm 1$. It is easy to check that both functions $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ satisfy the given functional equation, so these are the desired solutions.",
            "It is no hard to see that the two functions given by $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ for all real $x$ respectively solve the functional equation.

For this purpose, let us assume that $f(r)=f(s)$ for some $r \\neq s$. Then, by $(2)$\n\n$$\nr^{2}=f(r f(r))=f(r f(s))=f((s-r) f(r))+r^{2},\n$$\n\nwhere the last statement follows from the given functional equation with $x=r$ and $y=s-r$. Hence, $h=(s-r) f(r)$ satisfies $f(h)=0$ which implies $h^{2}=f(h f(h))=f(0)=0$, i.e., $h=0$. Then, by $s \\neq r$ we have $f(r)=0$ which implies $r=0$, and finally $f(s)=f(r)=f(0)=0$. Analogously, it follows that $s=0$ which gives the contradiction $r=s$.\n\nTo prove $|f(1)|=1$ we apply (2) with $t=1$ and also with $t=f(1)$ and obtain $f(f(1))=1$ and $(f(1))^{2}=f(f(1) \\cdot f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=1$.\n\nNow we choose $\\eta \\in\\{-1,1\\}$ with $f(1)=\\eta$.

Without loss of generality assume that the cells $C_{i i}$, $i=1, \\ldots, k$, form a separate rectangle. Then we may consider the boards $B_{k}=\\bigcup_{1<i<j<k} C_{i j}$ below that diagonal and the congruent board $B_{k}^{\\prime}=\\bigcup_{1<j<i<k} C_{i j}$ above that diagonal separately because no rectangle can simultaneously cover cells from $B_{k}$ and $B_{k}^{\\prime}$.

Then the overall answer to the problem is $2 \\cdot m 2^{m+1}+4 \\cdot 2^{m}=(m+1) 2^{m+2}$.\n\nFirst we inductively construct for $m \\geq 1$ a partition of $B_{2^{m}}$ with total perimeter $m 2^{m+1}$.

Let the assertion be true for all positive integers less than $k$. We investigate a fixed rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ that attains the minimal total perimeter. Let $R$ be the rectangle that covers the cell $C_{1 k}$ in the lower right corner. Let $(i, j)$ be the upper left corner of $R$. First we show that $i=j$. Assume that $i<j$. Then the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i+1, j)$ or from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j-1)$ must belong to the boundary of some rectangle in the partition. Without loss of generality assume that this is the case for the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i+1, j)$.\n\nCase 1. No line from $(i, l)$ to $(i+1, l)$ where $j<l<k$ belongs to the boundary of some rectangle of the partition.\n\nThen there is some rectangle $R^{\\prime}$ of the partition that has with $R$ the common side from $(i, j)$ to $(i, k)$. If we join these two rectangles to one rectangle we get a partition with smaller total perimeter, a contradiction.\n\nCase 2. There is some $l$ such that $j<l<k$ and the line from $(i, l)$ to $(i+1, l)$ belongs to the boundary of some rectangle of the partition.\n\nThen we replace the upper side of $R$ by the line $(i+1, j)$ to $(i+1, k)$ and for the rectangles whose lower side belongs to the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i, k)$ we shift the lower side upwards so that the new lower side belongs to the line from $(i+1, j)$ to $(i+1, k)$. In such a way we obtain a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ with smaller total perimeter, a contradiction.\n\nNow the fact that the upper left corner of $R$ has the coordinates $(i, i)$ is established. Consequently, the partition consists of $R$, of rectangles of a partition of a board congruent to $B_{i}$ and of rectangles of a partition of a board congruent to $B_{k-i}$.

Hence the total perimeter of the optimal partition of $B_{k}$ is at least $2 k+2 k / 2 \\log _{2} k / 2+2(k / 2) \\log _{2}(k / 2)=D_{k}$.",

Cinderella and her wicked Stepmother go through a sequence of rounds: At the beginning of every round, the Stepmother takes one liter of water from the nearby river and distributes it arbitrarily over the five buckets. Then Cinderella chooses a pair of neighboring buckets, empties them into the river, and puts them back. Then the next round begins. The Stepmother's goal is to make one of these buckets overflow. Cinderella's goal is to prevent this. Can the wicked Stepmother enforce a bucket overflow?",

For reasons of symmetry, we only consider the second case.\n\nThen Cinderella empties buckets $B_{0}$ and $B_{4}$.\n\nAt the beginning of the next round $B_{0}$ and $B_{4}$ are empty (condition (1) is fulfilled), due to $y_{1}+y_{3} \\leq 1$ condition (2) is fulfilled and finally since $x_{2}=0$ we also must have $y_{2} \\leq 1$ (condition (3) is fulfilled).\n\nTherefore, Cinderella can indeed manage to maintain the three conditions (1)-(3) also at the beginning of the $(r+1)$-th round. By induction, she thus manages to maintain them at the beginning of every round. In particular she manages to keep the contents of every single bucket at most 1 liter. Therefore, the buckets of 2-liter capacity will never overflow.",
            "We prove that Cinderella can maintain the following two conditions and hence she can prevent the buckets from overflow:\n\n$\\left(1^{\\prime}\\right)$ Every two non-adjacent buckets contain a total of at most 1.\n\n$\\left(2^{\\prime}\\right)$ The total contents of all five buckets is at most $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nWe use the same notations as in the first solution. The two conditions again clearly hold at the beginning. Assume that Cinderella maintained these two conditions until the beginning of the $r$-th round. A pair of non-neighboring buckets $\\left(B_{i}, B_{i+2}\\right), i=0,1,2,3,4$ is called critical\n\n\n\nif $y_{i}+y_{i+2}>1$. By condition $\\left(2^{\\prime}\\right)$, after the Stepmother has distributed her water we have $y_{0}+y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4} \\leq \\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\left(y_{0}+y_{2}\\right)+\\left(y_{1}+y_{3}\\right)+\\left(y_{2}+y_{4}\\right)+\\left(y_{3}+y_{0}\\right)+\\left(y_{4}+y_{1}\\right)=2\\left(y_{0}+y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}\\right) \\leq 5\n$$\n\nand hence there is a pair of non-neighboring buckets which is not critical, say $\\left(B_{0}, B_{2}\\right)$. Now, if both of the pairs $\\left(B_{3}, B_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left(B_{2}, B_{4}\\right)$ are critical, we must have $y_{1}<\\frac{1}{2}$ and Cinderella can empty the buckets $B_{3}$ and $B_{4}$. This clearly leaves no critical pair of buckets and the total contents of all the buckets is then $y_{1}+\\left(y_{0}+y_{2}\\right) \\leq \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, conditions $\\left(1^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(2^{\\prime}\\right)$ are fulfilled.\n\nNow suppose that without loss of generality the pair $\\left(B_{3}, B_{0}\\right)$ is not critical. If in this case $y_{0} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, then one of the inequalities $y_{0}+y_{1}+y_{2} \\leq \\frac{3}{2}$ and $y_{0}+y_{3}+y_{4} \\leq \\frac{3}{2}$ must hold. But then Cinderella can empty $B_{3}$ and $B_{4}$ or $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, respectively and clearly fulfill the conditions.\n\nFinally consider the case $y_{0}>\\frac{1}{2}$. By $y_{0}+y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4} \\leq \\frac{5}{2}$, at least one of the pairs $\\left(B_{1}, B_{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(B_{2}, B_{4}\\right)$ is not critical. Without loss of generality let this be the pair $\\left(B_{1}, B_{3}\\right)$. Since the pair $\\left(B_{3}, B_{0}\\right)$ is not critical and $y_{0}>\\frac{1}{2}$, we must have $y_{3} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. But then, as before, Cinderella can maintain the two conditions at the beginning of the next round by either emptying $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ or $B_{4}$ and $B_{0}$."

            "We construct the set of landing points of the grasshopper.\n\nCase 1. $M$ does not contain numbers divisible by 2009.\n\nWe fix the numbers $2009 k$ as landing points, $k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$. Consider the open intervals $I_{k}=(2009(k-1), 2009 k), k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$. We show that we can choose exactly one point outside of $M$ as a landing point in 1004 of these intervals such that all lengths from 1 to 2009 are realized. Since there remains one interval without a chosen point, the length 2009 indeed will appear. Each interval has length 2009, hence a new landing point in an interval yields with a length $d$ also the length $2009-d$. Thus it is enough to implement only the lengths from $D=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1004\\}$. We will do this in a greedy way. Let $n_{k}, k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$, be the number of elements of $M$ that belong to the interval $I_{k}$. We order these numbers in a decreasing way, so let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{1005}$ be a permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1005\\}$ such that $n_{p_{1}} \\geq n_{p_{2}} \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_{p_{1005}}$. In $I_{p_{1}}$ we do not choose a landing point. Assume that landing points have already been chosen in the intervals $I_{p_{2}}, \\ldots, I_{p_{m}}$ and the lengths $d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{m}$ from $D$ are realized, $m=1, \\ldots, 1004$. We show that there is some $d \\in D \\backslash\\left\\{d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right\\}$ that can be implemented with a new landing point in $I_{p_{m+1}}$. Assume the contrary. Then the $1004-(m-1)$ other lengths are obstructed by the $n_{p_{m+1}}$ points of $M$ in $I_{p_{m+1}}$. Each length $d$ can be realized by two landing points, namely $2009\\left(p_{m+1}-1\\right)+d$ and $2009 p_{m+1}-d$, hence\n\n$$\nn_{p_{m+1}} \\geq 2(1005-m)\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $|M|=2008=n_{1}+\\cdots+n_{1005}$,\n\n$$\n2008 \\geq n_{p_{1}}+n_{p_{2}}+\\cdots+n_{p_{m+1}} \\geq(m+1) n_{p_{m+1}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nConsequently, by (1) and (2),\n\n$$\n2008 \\geq 2(m+1)(1005-m)\n$$\n\nThe right hand side of the last inequality obviously attains its minimum for $m=1004$ and this minimum value is greater than 2008 , a contradiction.\n\nCase 2. $M$ does contain a number $\\mu$ divisible by 2009.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle there exists some $r \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 2008\\}$ such that $M$ does not contain numbers with remainder $r$ modulo 2009. We fix the numbers $2009(k-1)+r$ as landing points, $k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$. Moreover, $1005 \\cdot 2009$ is a landing point. Consider the open intervals\n\n\n\n$I_{k}=(2009(k-1)+r, 2009 k+r), k=1,2, \\ldots, 1004$. Analogously to Case 1 , it is enough to show that we can choose in 1003 of these intervals exactly one landing point outside of $M \\backslash\\{\\mu\\}$ such that each of the lengths of $D=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1004\\} \\backslash\\{r\\}$ are implemented. Note that $r$ and $2009-r$ are realized by the first and last jump and that choosing $\\mu$ would realize these two differences again. Let $n_{k}, k=1,2, \\ldots, 1004$, be the number of elements of $M \\backslash\\{\\mu\\}$ that belong to the interval $I_{k}$ and $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{1004}$ be a permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1004\\}$ such that $n_{p_{1}} \\geq n_{p_{2}} \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_{p_{1004}}$.

This fact will be used in the proof.\n\nWe prove the statement by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ is obvious. Let $n>0$ and let the assertion be true for all nonnegative integers less than $n$. Moreover let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n+1}, s$ and $M$ be given as in the problem. Without loss of generality we may assume that $a_{n+1}<a_{n}<$ $\\cdots<a_{2}<a_{1}$.

We will make use of the induction hypothesis as follows:\n\nClaim 1. It suffices to show that for some $m \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$ the grasshopper is able to do at least $m$ jumps without landing on a point of $M$ and, in addition, after these $m$ jumps he has jumped over at least $m$ points of $M$.\n\nProof. Note that $m=n+1$ is impossible by $|M|=n$. Now set $n^{\\prime}=n-m$. Then $0 \\leq n^{\\prime}<n$. The remaining $n^{\\prime}+1$ jumps can be carried out without landing on one of the remaining at most $n^{\\prime}$ forbidden points by the induction hypothesis together with a shift of the origin. This proves the claim.\n\nAn integer $k \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$ is called smooth, if the grasshopper is able to do $k$ jumps with the lengths $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ in such a way that he never lands on a point of $M$ except for the very last jump, when he may land on a point of $M$.\n\nObviously, 1 is smooth. Thus there is a largest number $k^{*}$, such that all the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, k^{*}$ are smooth. If $k^{*}=n+1$, the proof is complete. In the following let $k^{*} \\leq n$.\n\nClaim 2. We have\n\n$$\nT_{k^{*}} \\in M \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left|M \\cap\\left(0, T_{k^{*}}\\right)\\right| \\geq k^{*} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nProof. In the case $T_{k^{*}} \\notin M$ any sequence of jumps that verifies the smoothness of $k^{*}$ can be extended by appending $a_{k^{*}+1}$, which is a contradiction to the maximality of $k^{*}$. Therefore we have $T_{k^{*}} \\in M$. If $\\left|M \\cap\\left(0, T_{k^{*}}\\right)\\right|<k^{*}$, there exists an $l \\in\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, k^{*}\\right\\}$ with $T_{k^{*}+1}-a_{l} \\notin M$.

In the following let $\\bar{k}>1$. If $T_{\\bar{k}-1} \\in M$, then (4) follows immediately by the minimality of $\\bar{k}$.

We have\n\n$$\nh(x)= \\begin{cases}u v z & \\text { if } r=0 \\\\ u v z(r-1) v z(r-1) & \\text { if } r>0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nh\\left(g_{k}(x)\\right)=h(z r)= \\begin{cases}z & \\text { if } r=0 \\\\ z(r-1) z(r-1) & \\text { if } r>0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nRecall that $y$ and hence $v$ ends with a digit smaller than $k$, but all digits of $v$ are at least $r$.

Thus Lemma 1 is proved.\n\nLemma 2. Let $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 9\\}$, let $x$ be a non-empty string and let $n$ be a positive integer. If $h^{n}(x)=\\varepsilon$ then $\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n}(x)=\\varepsilon$.\n\nProof of Lemma 2. We proceed by induction on $n$. If $n=1$ we have\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=h(x)=g_{k}(h(x))=\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)(x) .\n$$\n\nNow consider the step from $n-1$ to $n$ where $n \\geq 2$. Let $h^{n}(x)=\\varepsilon$ and let $y=h(x)$. Then $h^{n-1}(y)=\\varepsilon$ and by the induction hypothesis $\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n-1}(y)=\\varepsilon$. In view of Lemma 1,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varepsilon=\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n-2}( & \\left.\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)(y)\\right)=\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n-2}\\left(g_{k}(h(y))\\right. \\\\\n& =\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n-2}\\left(g_{k}\\left(h\\left(g_{k}(y)\\right)\\right)=\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n-2}\\left(g_{k}\\left(h\\left(g_{k}(h(x))\\right)\\right)=\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{n}(x) .\\right.\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus the induction step is complete and Lemma 2 is proved.\n\nWe say that the non-empty string $x$ terminates if $h^{n}(x)=\\varepsilon$ for some non-negative integer $n$.\n\nLemma 3. Let $x=y z r$ where $s(y) \\geq k, s(z) \\geq k, y$ ends with the digit $k$ and $z$ is possibly empty. If $y$ and $z r$ terminate then also $x$ terminates.\n\nProof of Lemma 3. Suppose that $y$ and $z r$ terminate. We proceed by induction on $k$. Let $k=0$. Obviously, $h(y w)=y h(w)$ for any non-empty string $w$. Let $h^{n}(z r)=\\epsilon$. It follows easily by induction on $m$ that $h^{m}(y z r)=y h^{m}(z r)$ for $m=1, \\ldots, n$. Consequently, $h^{n}(y z r)=y$. Since $y$ terminates, also $x=y z r$ terminates.\n\nNow let the assertion be true for all nonnegative integers less than $k$ and let us prove it for $k$ where $k \\geq 1$. It turns out that it is sufficient to prove that $y g_{k}(h(z r))$ terminates. Indeed:\n\nCase 1. $r=0$.\n\nThen $h(y z r)=y z=y g_{k}(h(z r))$.\n\nCase 2. $0<r \\leq k$.\n\nWe have $h(z r)=z(r-1) z(r-1)$ and $g_{k}(h(z r))=z(r-1)$. Then $h(y z r)=y z(r-1) y z(r-1)=y g_{k}(h(z r)) y g_{k}(h(z r))$ and we may apply the induction hypothesis to see that if $\\left.y g_{k} h(z r)\\right)$ terminates, then $h(y z r)$ terminates.\n\nCase 3. $r>k$.\n\nThen $h(y z r)=y h(z r)=y g_{k}(h(z r))$.\n\nNote that $y g_{k}(h(z r))$ has the form $y z^{\\prime} r^{\\prime}$ where $s\\left(z^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq k$. By the same arguments it is sufficient to prove that $y g_{k}\\left(h\\left(z^{\\prime} r^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)=y\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{2}(z r)$ terminates and, by induction, that $y\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{m}(z r)$ terminates for some positive integer $m$. In view of Lemma 2 there is some $m$ such that $\\left(g_{k} \\circ\\right.$ $h)^{m}(z r)=\\epsilon$, so $x=y z r$ terminates if $y$ terminates. Thus Lemma 3 is proved.\n\nNow assume that there is some string $x$ that does not terminate. We choose $x$ minimal. If $x \\geq 10$, we can write $x$ in the form $x=y z r$ of Lemma 3 and by this lemma $x$ terminates since $y$ and $z r$ are smaller than $x$. If $x \\leq 9$, then $h(x)=(x-1)(x-1)$ and $h(x)$ terminates again by Lemma 3 and the minimal choice of $x$.",
            "We commence by introducing some terminology. Instead of integers, we will consider the set $S$ of all strings consisting of the digits $0,1, \\ldots, 9$, including the empty string $\\epsilon$. If $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ is a nonempty string, we let $\\rho(a)=a_{n}$ denote the terminal digit of $a$ and $\\lambda(a)$ be the string with the last digit removed. We also define $\\lambda(\\epsilon)=\\epsilon$ and denote the set of non-negative integers by $\\mathbb{N}_{0}$.\n\nNow let $k \\in\\{0,1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ denote any digit. We define a function $f_{k}: S \\longrightarrow S$ on the set of strings: First, if the terminal digit of $n$ belongs to $\\{0,1, \\ldots, k\\}$, then $f_{k}(n)$ is obtained from $n$ by deleting this terminal digit, i.e $f_{k}(n)=\\lambda(n)$. Secondly, if the terminal digit of $n$ belongs to $\\{k+1, \\ldots, 9\\}$, then $f_{k}(n)$ is obtained from $n$ by the process described in the problem. We also define $f_{k}(\\epsilon)=\\epsilon$. Note that up to the definition for integers $n \\leq 1$, the function $f_{0}$ coincides with the function $h$ in the problem, through interpreting integers as digit strings. The argument will be roughly as follows. We begin by introducing a straightforward generalization of our claim about $f_{0}$. Then it will be easy to see that $f_{9}$ has all these stronger properties, which means that is suffices to show for $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 8\\}$ that $f_{k}$ possesses these properties provided that $f_{k+1}$ does.\n\nWe continue to use $k$ to denote any digit. The operation $f_{k}$ is said to be separating, if the followings holds: Whenever $a$ is an initial segment of $b$, there is some $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ such that $f_{k}^{N}(b)=a$. The following two notions only apply to the case where $f_{k}$ is indeed separating, otherwise they remain undefined. For every $a \\in S$ we denote the least $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ for which $f_{k}^{N}(a)=\\epsilon$ occurs by $g_{k}(a)$ (because $\\epsilon$ is an initial segment of $a$, such an $N$ exists if $f_{k}$ is separating). If for every two strings $a$ and $b$ such that $a$ is a terminal segment of $b$ one has $g_{k}(a) \\leq g_{k}(b)$, we say that $f_{k}$ is coherent. In case that $f_{k}$ is separating and coherent we call the digit $k$ seductive.\n\nAs $f_{9}(a)=\\lambda(a)$ for all $a$, it is obvious that 9 is seductive. Hence in order to show that 0 is seductive, which clearly implies the statement of the problem, it suffices to take any $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 8\\}$ such that $k+1$ is seductive and to prove that $k$ has to be seductive as well. Note that in doing so, we have the function $g_{k+1}$ at our disposal. We have to establish two things and we begin with\n\nStep 1. $f_{k}$ is separating.\n\nBefore embarking on the proof of this, we record a useful observation which is easily proved by induction on $M$.\n\n\n\nClaim 1. For any strings $A, B$ and any positive integer $M$ such that $f_{k}^{M-1}(B) \\neq \\epsilon$, we have\n\n$$\nf_{k}^{M}(A k B)=A k f_{k}^{M}(B)\n$$\n\nNow we call a pair $(a, b)$ of strings wicked provided that $a$ is an initial segment of $b$, but there is no $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ such that $f_{k}^{N}(b)=a$. We need to show that there are none, so assume that there were such pairs. Choose a wicked pair $(a, b)$ for which $g_{k+1}(b)$ attains its minimal possible value. Obviously $b \\neq \\epsilon$ for any wicked pair $(a, b)$. Let $z$ denote the terminal digit of $b$. Observe that $a \\neq b$, which means that $a$ is also an initial segment of $\\lambda(b)$. To facilitate the construction of the eventual contradiction, we prove\n\nClaim 2. There cannot be an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ such that\n\n$$\nf_{k}^{N}(b)=\\lambda(b)\n$$\n\nProof of Claim 2. For suppose that such an $N$ existed. Because $g_{k+1}(\\lambda(b))<g_{k+1}(b)$ in view of the coherency of $f_{k+1}$, the pair $(a, \\lambda(b))$ is not wicked. But then there is some $N^{\\prime}$ for which $f_{k}^{N^{\\prime}}(\\lambda(b))=a$ which entails $f_{k}^{N+N^{\\prime}}(b)=a$, contradiction. Hence Claim 2 is proved.\n\nIt follows that $z \\leq k$ is impossible, for otherwise $N=1$ violated Claim 2.\n\nAlso $z>k+1$ is impossible: Set $B=f_{k}(b)$. Then also $f_{k+1}(b)=B$, but $g_{k+1}(B)<g_{k+1}(b)$ and $a$ is an initial segment of $B$. Thus the pair $(a, B)$ is not wicked. Hence there is some $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ with $a=f_{k}^{N}(B)$, which, however, entails $a=f_{k}^{N+1}(b)$.\n\nWe are left with the case $z=k+1$. Let $L$ denote the left part and $R=R^{*}(k+1)$ the right part of $b$. Then we have symbolically\n\n$$\nf_{k}(b)=L R^{*} k R^{*} k, f_{k}^{2}(b)=L R^{*} k R^{*} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f_{k+1}(b)=L R^{*}\n$$\n\nUsing that $R^{*}$ is a terminal segment of $L R^{*}$ and the coherency of $f_{k+1}$, we infer\n\n$$\ng_{k+1}\\left(R^{*}\\right) \\leq g_{k+1}\\left(L R^{*}\\right)<g_{k+1}(b) .\n$$\n\nHence the pair $\\left(\\epsilon, R^{*}\\right)$ is not wicked, so there is some minimal $M \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ with $f_{k}^{M}\\left(R^{*}\\right)=\\epsilon$ and by Claim 1 it follows that $f_{k}^{2+M}(b)=L R^{*} k$. Finally, we infer that $\\lambda(b)=L R^{*}=f_{k}\\left(L R^{*} k\\right)=$ $f_{k}^{3+M}(b)$, which yields a contradiction to Claim 2 .\n\nThis final contradiction establishes that $f_{k}$ is indeed separating.\n\nStep 2. $f_{k}$ is coherent.\n\nTo prepare the proof of this, we introduce some further pieces of terminology. A nonempty string $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ is called a hypostasis, if $a_{n}<a_{i}$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$. Reading an arbitrary string $a$ backwards, we easily find a, possibly empty, sequence $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ of hypostases such that $\\rho\\left(A_{1}\\right) \\leq \\rho\\left(A_{2}\\right) \\leq \\cdots \\leq \\rho\\left(A_{m}\\right)$ and, symbolically, $a=A_{1} A_{2} \\ldots A_{m}$. The latter sequence is referred to as the decomposition of $a$. So, for instance, $(20,0,9)$ is the decomposition of 2009 and the string 50 is a hypostasis. Next we explain when we say about two strings $a$ and $b$ that $a$ is injectible into $b$. The definition is by induction on the length of $b$. Let $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $b$ into hypostases. Then $a$ is injectible into $b$ if for the decomposition $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ of $a$ there is a strictly increasing function $H:\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(A_{i}\\right)=\\rho\\left(B_{H(i)}\\right) \\text { for all } i=1, \\ldots, m \\text {; }\n$$\n\n\n\n$\\lambda\\left(A_{i}\\right)$ is injectible into $\\lambda\\left(B_{H(i)}\\right)$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, m$.\n\nIf one can choose $H$ with $H(m)=n$, then we say that $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$. Obviously, if $a$ is a terminal segment of $b$, then $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$.\n\nClaim 3. If $a$ and $b$ are two nonempty strings such that $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$, then $\\lambda(a)$ is injectible into $\\lambda(b)$.\n\nProof of Claim 3. Let $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $b$ and let $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $a$. Take a function $H$ exemplifying that $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$. Let $\\left(C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{r}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $\\lambda\\left(A_{m}\\right)$ and let $\\left(D_{1}, D_{2}, \\ldots, D_{s}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $\\lambda\\left(B_{n}\\right)$. Choose a strictly increasing $H^{\\prime}:\\{1,2, \\ldots, r\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots s\\}$ witnessing that $\\lambda\\left(A_{m}\\right)$ is injectible into $\\lambda\\left(B_{n}\\right)$. Clearly, $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m-1}, C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{r}\\right)$ is the decomposition of $\\lambda(a)$ and $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n-1}, D_{1}, D_{2}, \\ldots, D_{s}\\right)$ is the decomposition of $\\lambda(b)$. Then the function $H^{\\prime \\prime}:\\{1,2, \\ldots, m+r-1\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+s-1\\}$ given by $H^{\\prime \\prime}(i)=H(i)$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, m-1$ and $H^{\\prime \\prime}(m-1+i)=n-1+H^{\\prime}(i)$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, r$ exemplifies that $\\lambda(a)$ is injectible into $\\lambda(b)$, which finishes the proof of the claim.\n\nA pair $(a, b)$ of strings is called aggressive if $a$ is injectible into $b$ and nevertheless $g_{k}(a)>g_{k}(b)$. Observe that if $f_{k}$ was incoherent, which we shall assume from now on, then such pairs existed. Now among all aggressive pairs we choose one, say $(a, b)$, for which $g_{k}(b)$ attains its least possible value. Obviously $f_{k}(a)$ cannot be injectible into $f_{k}(b)$, for otherwise the pair $\\left(f_{k}(a), f_{k}(b)\\right)$ was aggressive and contradicted our choice of $(a, b)$. Let $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ and $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ be the decompositions of $a$ and $b$ and take a function $H:\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ exemplifying that $a$ is indeed injectible into $b$. If we had $H(m)<n$, then $a$ was also injectible into the number $b^{\\prime}$ whose decomposition is $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n-1}\\right)$ and by separativity of $f_{k}$ we obtained $g_{k}\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right)<g_{k}(b)$, whence the pair $\\left(a, b^{\\prime}\\right)$ was also aggressive, contrary to the minimality condition imposed on $b$. Therefore $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$. In particular, $a$ and $b$ have a common terminal digit, say $z$. If we had $z \\leq k$, then $f_{k}(a)=\\lambda(a)$ and $f_{k}(b)=\\lambda(b)$, so that by Claim $3, f_{k}(a)$ was injectible into $f_{k}(b)$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $z \\geq k+1$.\n\nNow let $r$ be the minimal element of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\}$ for which $\\rho\\left(A_{r}\\right)=z$. Then the maximal right part of $a$ consisting of digits $\\geq z$ is equal to $R_{a}$, the string whose decomposition is $\\left(A_{r}, A_{r+1}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$. Then $R_{a}-1$ is a hypostasis and $\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{r-1}, R_{a}-1, R_{a}-1\\right)$ is the decomposition of $f_{k}(a)$. Defining $s$ and $R_{b}$ in a similar fashion with respect to $b$, we see that $\\left(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{s-1}, R_{b}-1, R_{b}-1\\right)$ is the decomposition of $f_{k}(b)$. The definition of injectibility then easily entails that $R_{a}$ is strongly injectible into $R_{b}$. It follows from Claim 3 that $\\lambda\\left(R_{a}\\right)=$ $\\lambda\\left(R_{a}-1\\right)$ is injectible into $\\lambda\\left(R_{b}\\right)=\\lambda\\left(R_{b}-1\\right)$, whence the function $H^{\\prime}:\\{1,2, \\ldots, r+1\\} \\longrightarrow$ $\\{1,2, \\ldots, s+1\\}$, given by $H^{\\prime}(i)=H(i)$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, r-1, H^{\\prime}(r)=s$ and $H^{\\prime}(r+1)=s+1$ exemplifies that $f_{k}(a)$ is injectible into $f_{k}(b)$, which yields a contradiction as before.\n\nThis shows that aggressive pairs cannot exist, whence $f_{k}$ is indeed coherent, which finishes the proof of the seductivity of $k$, whereby the problem is finally solved."

            "It suffices to show that $\\angle H E F=\\angle H G E$ (see Figure 1), since in circle $E G H$ the angle over the chord $E H$ at $G$ equals the angle between the tangent at $E$ and $E H$.\n\nFirst, $\\angle B A D=180^{\\circ}-\\angle D C B=\\angle F C D$. Since triangles $F A B$ and $F C D$ have also a common interior angle at $F$, they are similar.\n\n<img_3775>\n\nFigure 1\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{T}$ the transformation consisting of a reflection at the bisector of $\\angle D F C$ followed by a dilation with center $F$ and factor of $\\frac{F A}{F C}$. Then $\\mathcal{T}$ maps $F$ to $F, C$ to $A, D$ to $B$, and $H$ to $G$. To see this, note that $\\triangle F C A \\sim \\triangle F D B$, so $\\frac{F A}{F C}=\\frac{F B}{F D}$. Moreover, as $\\angle A D B=\\angle A C B$, the image of the line $D E$ under $\\mathcal{T}$ is parallel to $A C$ (and passes through $B$ ) and similarly the image of $C E$ is parallel to $D B$ and passes through $A$. Hence $E$ is mapped to the point $X$ which is the fourth vertex of the parallelogram $B E A X$. Thus, in particular $\\angle H E F=\\angle F X G$.\n\nAs $G$ is the midpoint of the diagonal $A B$ of the parallelogram $B E A X$, it is also the midpoint of $E X$. In particular, $E, G, X$ are collinear, and $E X=2 \\cdot E G$.\n\nDenote by $Y$ the fourth vertex of the parallelogram $D E C Y$. By an analogous reasoning as before, it follows that $\\mathcal{T}$ maps $Y$ to $E$, thus $E, H, Y$ are collinear with $E Y=2 \\cdot E H$. Therefore, by the intercept theorem, $H G \\| X Y$.\n\nFrom the construction of $\\mathcal{T}$ it is clear that the lines $F X$ and $F E$ are symmetric with respect to the bisector of $\\angle D F C$, as are $F Y$ and $F E$. Thus, $F, X, Y$ are collinear, which together with $H G \\| X Y$ implies $\\angle F X E=\\angle H G E$. This completes the proof.",

Then the midpoints $K, L, M$ of $A C, B D$, and $P Q$, respectively, are collinear.\n\nProof: Let us consider the points $Z$ that fulfill the equation\n\n$$\n(A B Z)+(C D Z)=(B C Z)+(D A Z),\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $(R S T)$ denotes the oriented area of the triangle $R S T$ (see Figure 2).\n\n<img_3917>\n\nFigure 2\n\nAs (1) is linear in $Z$, it can either characterize a line, or be contradictory, or be trivially fulfilled for all $Z$ in the plane. If (1) was fulfilled for all $Z$, then it would hold for $Z=A, Z=B$, which gives $(C D A)=(B C A),(C D B)=(D A B)$, respectively, i.e. the diagonals of $A B C D$ would bisect each other, thus $A B C D$ would be a parallelogram. This contradicts the hypothesis that $A D$ and $B C$ intersect. Since $E, F, G$ fulfill (1), it is the equation of a line which completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nNow consider the parallelograms $E A X B$ and $E C Y D$ (see Figure 1). Then $G, H$ are the midpoints of $E X, E Y$, respectively. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $E F$. By applying the Lemma to the (re-entrant) quadrilateral $A D B C$, it is evident that $G, H$, and $M$ are collinear. A dilation by a factor of 2 with center $E$ shows that $X, Y, F$ are collinear. Since $A X \\| D E$ and $B X \\| C E$, we have pairwise equal interior angles in the quadrilaterals $F D E C$ and $F B X A$. Since we have also $\\angle E B A=\\angle D C A=\\angle C D Y$, the quadrilaterals are similar. Thus, $\\angle F X A=\\angle C E F$.\n\nClearly the parallelograms $E C Y D$ and $E B X A$ are similar, too, thus $\\angle E X A=\\angle C E Y$. Consequently, $\\angle F X E=\\angle F X A-\\angle E X A=\\angle C E F-\\angle C E Y=\\angle Y E F$. By the converse of the tangent-chord angle theorem $E F$ is tangent to the circle $X E Y$.

Since $3 p$ is not a power of 2 , its binary expansion contains at least two summands. Hence one can write $3 p=2^{a}+2^{b}+c$ where $a>b$ and $2^{b}>c \\geq 0$. Applying the recurrence formula twice yields\n\n$$\nf(3 p)=f\\left(2^{a}+2^{b}+c\\right)=f\\left(2^{a}-t\\left(2^{b}+c\\right)\\right)-f\\left(2^{b}-t(c)\\right)+f(c) .\n$$\n\nSince $2^{a}+2^{b}+c$ is divisible by 3 , we have $f\\left(2^{a}-t\\left(2^{b}+c\\right)\\right) \\geq 3^{(a-1) / 2}$ by (i).

For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ we have by (1)\n\n$$\nf\\left(u+\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right)=f\\left(x+\\frac{1}{f(u)}\\right)=f\\left(x+\\frac{1}{f(v)}\\right)=f\\left(v+\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right) .\n$$\n\nSince $f(x)$ attains all positive integer values, this yields $f(u+1 / n)=f(v+1 / n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $q=k / n$ be a positive rational number. Then $k$ repetitions of the last step yield\n\n$$\nf(u+q)=f\\left(u+\\frac{k}{n}\\right)=f\\left(v+\\frac{k}{n}\\right)=f(v+q)\n$$\n\nNow let $f(q)=1$ for some nonnegative rational $q$, and let $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. As $f(0)=1$, the previous conclusion yields successively $f(q)=f(2 q), f(2 q)=f(3 q), \\ldots, f((k-1) q)=f(k q)$, as needed.\n\nClaim 3. The equality $f(q)=f(q+1)$ holds for all nonnegative rational $q$.\n\nProof. Let $m$ be a positive integer such that $f(1 / m)=1$. Such an $m$ exists by (2). Applying the second statement of Claim 2 with $q=1 / m$ and $k=m$ yields $f(1)=1$.\n\nGiven that $f(0)=f(1)=1$, the first statement of Claim 2 implies $f(q)=f(q+1)$ for all nonnegative rational $q$.\n\n\n\nClaim 4. The equality $f\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)=n$ holds for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nProof. For a nonnegative rational $q$ we set $x=q, y=0$ in (1) and use Claim 3 to obtain\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{f(q)}\\right)=f\\left(q+\\frac{1}{f(0)}\\right)=f(q+1)=f(q)\n$$\n\nBy (2), for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(1 / k)=n$. Applying the last equation with $q=1 / k$, we have\n\n$$\nn=f\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(1 / k)}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we are ready to obtain a contradiction. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be such that $f(1 / 3+1 / n)=1$. Such an $n$ exists by (2). Let $1 / 3+1 / n=s / t$, where $s, t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ are coprime. Observe that $t>1$ as $1 / 3+1 / n$ is not an integer. Choose $k, l \\in \\mathbb{N}$ so that that $k s-l t=1$.\n\nBecause $f(0)=f(s / t)=1$, Claim 2 implies $f(k s / t)=1$. Now $f(k s / t)=f(1 / t+l)$; on the other hand $f(1 / t+l)=f(1 / t)$ by $l$ successive applications of Claim 3 . Finally, $f(1 / t)=t$ by Claim 4, leading to the impossible $t=1$. The solution is complete."

Let $p<q$ (the case $p>q$ is analogous; and the claim is true for $p=q$ as $f\\left(A_{i}\\right)=0$ for all $i$ ).\n\nWe are ready to prove that at least two of the sets $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{k+\\ell}$ are nice.

This gives at least $2(k+\\ell)$ ! nice sets, counted with repetitions: each nice set is counted as many times as there are permutations to which it is assigned.\n\nOn the other hand, each $k$-element set $A \\subset S$ is assigned to exactly $(k+\\ell) k ! \\ell$ ! permutations. Indeed, such a permutation $\\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{k+\\ell}\\right)$ is determined by three independent choices: an in$\\operatorname{dex} i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, k+\\ell\\}$ such that $A=\\left\\{y_{i}, y_{i+1}, \\ldots, y_{i+k-1}\\right\\}$, a permutation $\\left(y_{i}, y_{i+1}, \\ldots, y_{i+k-1}\\right)$ of the set $A$, and a permutation $\\left(y_{i+k}, y_{i+k+1}, \\ldots, y_{i-1}\\right)$ of the set $S \\backslash A$.\n\nIn summary, there are at least $\\frac{2(k+\\ell) !}{(k+\\ell) k ! \\ell !}=\\frac{2}{k+\\ell}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+\\ell \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ nice sets."

            "We prove that there exists a set $S_{a}$ with at most $3 n+1$ elements.\n\nGiven a $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, we say that an element $z \\in A$ is $k$-good to a set $S_{a}$ if $z \\in S_{a}$ and $S_{a}$ contains two other elements $x$ and $y$ with $x<y<z$ such that $z-y<2^{k}$ and $z-x \\geq 2^{k}$. Also, $z \\in A$ will be called $\\operatorname{good}$ to $S_{a}$ if $z$ is $k$-good to $S_{a}$ for some $k=1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nWe claim that each $z \\in A$ can be $k$-good to at most one set $S_{a}$. Indeed, suppose on the contrary that $z$ is $k$-good simultaneously to $S_{a}$ and $S_{b}$, with $a<b$. Then there exist $y_{a} \\in S_{a}$, $y_{a}<z$, and $x_{b} \\in S_{b}, x_{b}<z$, such that $z-y_{a}<2^{k}$ and $z-x_{b} \\geq 2^{k}$. On the other hand, since $z \\in S_{a} \\cap S_{b}$, by the condition of the problem there is no element of $S_{a}$ strictly between $x_{b}$ and $z$. Hence $y_{a} \\leq x_{b}$, implying $z-y_{a} \\geq z-x_{b}$. However this contradicts $z-y_{a}<2^{k}$ and $z-x_{b} \\geq 2^{k}$. The claim follows.\n\nAs a consequence, a fixed $z \\in A$ can be good to at most $n$ of the given sets (no more than one of them for each $k=1, \\ldots, n$ ).\n\nFurthermore, let $u_{1}<u_{2}<\\cdots<u_{m}<\\cdots<u_{p}$ be all elements of a fixed set $S_{a}$ that are not good to $S_{a}$. We prove that $u_{m}-u_{1}>2\\left(u_{m-1}-u_{1}\\right)$ for all $m \\geq 3$.\n\nIndeed, assume that $u_{m}-u_{1} \\leq 2\\left(u_{m-1}-u_{1}\\right)$ holds for some $m \\geq 3$. This inequality can be written as $2\\left(u_{m}-u_{m-1}\\right) \\leq u_{m}-u_{1}$. Take the unique $k$ such that $2^{k} \\leq u_{m}-u_{1}<2^{k+1}$. Then $2\\left(u_{m}-u_{m-1}\\right) \\leq u_{m}-u_{1}<2^{k+1}$ yields $u_{m}-u_{m-1}<2^{k}$. However the elements $z=u_{m}, x=u_{1}$, $y=u_{m-1}$ of $S_{a}$ then satisfy $z-y<2^{k}$ and $z-x \\geq 2^{k}$, so that $z=u_{m}$ is $k$-good to $S_{a}$.\n\nThus each term of the sequence $u_{2}-u_{1}, u_{3}-u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{p}-u_{1}$ is more than twice the previous one. Hence $u_{p}-u_{1}>2^{p-1}\\left(u_{2}-u_{1}\\right) \\geq 2^{p-1}$. But $u_{p} \\in\\left\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 2^{n+1}\\right\\}$, so that $u_{p} \\leq 2^{n+1}$. This yields $p-1 \\leq n$, i. e. $p \\leq n+1$.\n\nIn other words, each set $S_{a}$ contains at most $n+1$ elements that are not good to it.\n\nTo summarize the conclusions, mark with red all elements in the sets $S_{a}$ that are good to the respective set, and with blue the ones that are not good. Then the total number of red elements, counting multiplicities, is at most $n \\cdot 2^{n+1}$ (each $z \\in A$ can be marked red in at most $n$ sets). The total number of blue elements is at most $(n+1) 2^{n}$ (each set $S_{a}$ contains at most $n+1$ blue elements). Therefore the sum of cardinalities of $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{2^{n}}$ does not exceed $(3 n+1) 2^{n}$. By averaging, the smallest set has at most $3 n+1$ elements.",
            "We show that one of the sets $S_{a}$ has at most $2 n+1$ elements. In the sequel $|\\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality of a (finite) set.\n\nClaim.

Then\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-n\\right) \\leq(2 n-1) 2^{n-2}\n$$\n\nProof. Observe that if the sets $S_{i}(1 \\leq i \\leq k)$ satisfy the condition then so do their arbitrary subsets $T_{i}(1 \\leq i \\leq k)$. The condition also holds for the sets $t+S_{i}=\\left\\{t+x \\mid x \\in S_{i}\\right\\}$ where $t$ is arbitrary.\n\nNote also that a set may occur more than once among $S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{k}$ only if its cardinality is less than 3, in which case its contribution to the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-n\\right.$ ) is nonpositive (as $n \\geq 2$ ).\n\nThe proof is by induction on $n$. In the base case $n=2$ we have subsets $S_{i}$ of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.

If $S_{i}=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ for some $i$ then no $S_{j}$ is a 3 -element subset in view of the condition, hence $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2\\right) \\leq 2$. By the condition again, it is impossible that $S_{i}=\\{1,3,4\\}$ and $S_{j}=\\{2,3,4\\}$ for some $i, j$. So if $\\left|S_{i}\\right| \\leq 3$ for all $i$ then at most 3 summands $\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2$ are positive, corresponding to 3 -element subsets. This implies $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2\\right) \\leq 3$, therefore the conclusion is true for $n=2$.\n\nSuppose that the claim holds for some $n \\geq 2$, and let the sets $S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{k} \\subseteq\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2^{n+1}\\right\\}$ satisfy the given property.

Observe that if $V_{a}$ and $V_{b}$ intersect, with $a<b$, $a, b \\in I$, then $v_{a}$ is their unique common element. Indeed, let $z \\in V_{a} \\cap V_{b} \\subseteq S_{a} \\cap S_{b}$ and let $m$ be the least element of $S_{b}$. Since $b \\in I$, we have $m \\leq 2^{n}$. By the condition, there is no element of $S_{a}$ strictly between $m \\leq 2^{n}$ and $z>2^{n}$, which implies $z=v_{a}$.\n\nIt follows that if the element $v_{i}$ is removed from each $V_{i}$, a family of pairwise disjoint sets $W_{i}=V_{i} \\backslash\\left\\{v_{i}\\right\\}$ is obtained, $i \\in I$ (we assume $W_{i}=\\emptyset$ if $V_{i}=\\emptyset$ ).

So they meet at $O$, the circumcentre of $A B C$. Thus $O$ is the only point that can possibly be the centre of the desired circle.\n\nFrom the right triangle $O A_{0} A_{1}$ we get\n\n$$\nO A_{1}^{2}=O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} A_{1}^{2}=O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} H^{2} .\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nLet $K$ be the midpoint of $A H$ and let $L$ be the midpoint of $C H$. Since $A_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are the midpoints of $B C$ and $C A$, we see that $A_{0} L \\| B H$ and $B_{0} L \\| A H$. Thus the segments $A_{0} L$ and $B_{0} L$ are perpendicular to $A C$ and $B C$, hence parallel to $O B_{0}$ and $O A_{0}$, respectively. Consequently $O A_{0} L B_{0}$ is a parallelogram, so that $O A_{0}$ and $B_{0} L$ are equal and parallel. Also, the midline $B_{0} L$ of triangle $A H C$ is equal and parallel to $A K$ and $K H$.\n\nIt follows that $A K A_{0} O$ and $H A_{0} O K$ are parallelograms.

Therefore $X E^{2}=X P \\cdot X Q$.\n\nIt is not hard to see that this equation determines the position of the point $X$ on the line $P Q$ uniquely. Thus, if $B C$ also cuts $P Q$, say at $Y$, then the analogous equation for $Y$ yields $X=Y$, meaning that the three lines indeed concur. In this case, as well as in the case where $A D\\|P Q\\| B C$, the concluding argument is the same as in the first solution.\n\nIt remains to eliminate the possibility that e.g. $A D$ meets $P Q$ at $X$ while $B C \\| P Q$. Indeed, $Q P B C$ would then be an isosceles trapezoid and the angle equality $\\angle P B E=\\angle Q C E$ would force that $E$ is the midpoint of $P Q$. So the length of $X E$, which is the geometric mean of the lengths of $X P$ and $X Q$, should also be their arithmetic mean -impossible, as $X P \\neq X Q$. The proof is now complete."

Consider the altitude $A D$ of triangle $A B C$ and its orthocentre $H$. From the cyclic quadrilaterals $C D F A$ and $C D H E$ we get $B A \\cdot B F=B C \\cdot B D=B E \\cdot B H$. Thus $B P^{2}=B E \\cdot B H$, or $B P / B H=B E / B P$, implying that the triangles $B P H$ and $B E P$ are similar. Hence\n\n$$\n\\angle B P E=\\angle B H P \\text {. }\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nThe point $P$ lies between $D$ and $C$; this follows from the equality $B P^{2}=B C \\cdot B D$.

Combining these equalities we obtain $A D \\cdot D H=D P \\cdot D Q$. Therefore $D H / D P=D Q / D A$, showing that the triangles $H D P$ and $Q D A$ are similar. Hence $\\angle H P D=\\angle Q A D$, which can be rewritten as $\\angle B P H=\\angle B A D+\\angle B A Q$.

Let $P$ and $Q$ have orders $p$ and $q$, respectively, with $p \\geq q$. Consider triangle $O P Q$. Now $p$ equals the number of lines in $L$ that intersect the interior of side $O P$. None of these lines intersects the interior of side $P Q$, and at most one can pass through $Q$. All remaining lines must intersect the interior of side $O Q$, implying that $q \\geq p-1$. The conclusion follows.\n\nWe prove the main result by induction on $k$. The base $k=0$ is clear since there is a point of order 0 which is red.

By hypothesis of induction, there are at least $\\frac{1}{2} k(k+1)$ points of order not exceeding $k-1$ in the resulting configuration. Restoring $\\ell$ back produces at most one new intersection point on each line segment joining any of these points to $O$, so their order is at most $k$ in the original configuration. The total number of points with order not exceeding $k$ is therefore at least $(k+1)+\\frac{1}{2} k(k+1)=\\frac{1}{2}(k+1)(k+2)$. This completes the proof."

Since $\\angle N A P=\\angle D A U_{A}=$ $\\angle B A C$, as specified above, we obtain $\\angle N K P=\\angle B A C$.

Given a convex quadrilateral $A B C D$, suppose that there exists a circle which is inscribed in angle $A B C$ and tangent to the extensions of line segments $A D$ and $C D$. Then $A B+A D=C B+C D$.\n\nProof.

Then\n\n$$\nA B+A D=(B K-A K)+(A N-D N), \\quad C B+C D=(B L-C L)+(C M-D M) .\n$$\n\nAlso $B K=B L, D N=D M, A K=A N, C L=C M$ by equalities of tangents. It follows that $A B+A D=C B+C D$.\n\n<img_3618>\n\nFor brevity, in the sequel we write \"excircle $A C$ \" for the excircle of a triangle with side $A C$ which is tangent to line segment $A C$ and the extensions of the other two sides.\n\nLemma 2. The incircle of triangle $A B C$ is tangent to its side $A C$ at $P$. Let $P P^{\\prime}$ be the diameter of the incircle through $P$, and let line $B P^{\\prime}$ intersect $A C$ at $Q$. Then $Q$ is the point of tangency of side $A C$ and excircle $A C$.\n\nProof. Let the tangent at $P^{\\prime}$ to the incircle $\\omega_{1}$ meet $B A$ and $B C$ at $A^{\\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime}$. Now $\\omega_{1}$ is the excircle $A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ of triangle $A^{\\prime} B C^{\\prime}$, and it touches side $A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ at $P^{\\prime}$. Since $A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} \\| A C$, the homothety with centre $B$ and ratio $B Q / B P^{\\prime}$ takes $\\omega_{1}$ to the excircle $A C$ of triangle $A B C$. Because this homothety takes $P^{\\prime}$ to $Q$, the lemma follows.\n\n\n\nRecall also that if the incircle of a triangle touches its side $A C$ at $P$, then the tangency point $Q$ of the same side and excircle $A C$ is the unique point on line segment $A C$ such that $A P=C Q$.\n\nWe pass on to the main proof. Let $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ touch $A C$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively; then $A P=(A C+A B-B C) / 2, C Q=(C A+C D-A D) / 2$. Since $A B-B C=C D-A D$ by Lemma 1, we obtain $A P=C Q$. It follows that in triangle $A B C$ side $A C$ and excircle $A C$ are tangent at $Q$. Likewise, in triangle $A D C$ side $A C$ and excircle $A C$ are tangent at $P$. Note that $P \\neq Q$ as $A B \\neq B C$.\n\nLet $P P^{\\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\\prime}$ be the diameters perpendicular to $A C$ of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$, respectively. Then Lemma 2 shows that points $B, P^{\\prime}$ and $Q$ are collinear, and so are points $D, Q^{\\prime}$ and $P$.\n\nConsider the diameter of $\\omega$ perpendicular to $A C$ and denote by $T$ its endpoint that is closer to $A C$. The homothety with centre $B$ and ratio $B T / B P^{\\prime}$ takes $\\omega_{1}$ to $\\omega$. Hence $B, P^{\\prime}$ and $T$ are collinear. Similarly, $D, Q^{\\prime}$ and $T$ are collinear since the homothety with centre $D$ and ratio $-D T / D Q^{\\prime}$ takes $\\omega_{2}$ to $\\omega$.\n\nWe infer that points $T, P^{\\prime}$ and $Q$ are collinear, as well as $T, Q^{\\prime}$ and $P$. Since $P P^{\\prime} \\| Q Q^{\\prime}$, line segments $P P^{\\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\\prime}$ are then homothetic with centre $T$. The same holds true for circles $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ because they have $P P^{\\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\\prime}$ as diameters. Moreover, it is immediate that $T$ lies on the same side of line $P P^{\\prime}$ as $Q$ and $Q^{\\prime}$, hence the ratio of homothety is positive. In particular $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ are not congruent.\n\nIn summary, $T$ is the centre of a homothety with positive ratio that takes circle $\\omega_{1}$ to circle $\\omega_{2}$. This completes the solution, since the only point with the mentioned property is the intersection of the the common external tangents of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$."

            "If two of $a, b, c$ are equal, it is immediate that all the three are equal. So we may assume that $a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a$. Subtracting the equations we get $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ and two cyclic copies of this equation, which upon multiplication yield\n\n$$\n\\frac{a^{n}-b^{n}}{a-b} \\cdot \\frac{b^{n}-c^{n}}{b-c} \\cdot \\frac{c^{n}-a^{n}}{c-a}=-p^{3}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nIf $n$ is odd then the differences $a^{n}-b^{n}$ and $a-b$ have the same sign and the product on the left is positive, while $-p^{3}$ is negative. So $n$ must be even.\n\nLet $d$ be the greatest common divisor of the three differences $a-b, b-c, c-a$, so that $a-b=d u, \\quad b-c=d v, \\quad c-a=d w ; \\quad \\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1, u+v+w=0$.\n\nFrom $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ we see that $(a-b) \\mid p(b-c)$, i.e., $u \\mid p v$; and cyclically $v|p w, w| p u$. As $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1$ and $u+v+w=0$, at most one of $u, v, w$ can be divisible by $p$. Supposing that the prime $p$ does not divide any one of them, we get $u|v, v| w, w \\mid u$, whence $|u|=|v|=|w|=1$; but this quarrels with $u+v+w=0$.\n\nThus $p$ must divide exactly one of these numbers. Let e.g. $p \\mid u$ and write $u=p u_{1}$. Now we obtain, similarly as before, $u_{1}|v, v| w, w \\mid u_{1}$ so that $\\left|u_{1}\\right|=|v|=|w|=1$. The equation $p u_{1}+v+w=0$ forces that the prime $p$ must be even; i.e. $p=2$. Hence $v+w=-2 u_{1}= \\pm 2$, implying $v=w(= \\pm 1)$ and $u=-2 v$. Consequently $a-b=-2(b-c)$.\n\nKnowing that $n$ is even, say $n=2 k$, we rewrite the equation $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ with $p=2$ in the form\n\n$$\n\\left(a^{k}+b^{k}\\right)\\left(a^{k}-b^{k}\\right)=-2(b-c)=a-b .\n$$\n\nThe second factor on the left is divisible by $a-b$, so the first factor $\\left(a^{k}+b^{k}\\right)$ must be \\pm 1 . Then exactly one of $a$ and $b$ must be odd; yet $a-b=-2(b-c)$ is even. Contradiction ends the proof.",
            "The beginning is as in the first solution. Assuming that $a, b, c$ are not all equal, hence are all distinct, we derive equation (1) with the conclusion that $n$ is even. Write $n=2 k$.\n\nSuppose that $p$ is odd. Then the integer\n\n$$\n\\frac{a^{n}-b^{n}}{a-b}=a^{n-1}+a^{n-2} b+\\cdots+b^{n-1},\n$$\n\n\n\nwhich is a factor in (1), must be odd as well. This sum of $n=2 k$ summands is odd only if $a$ and $b$ have different parities. The same conclusion holding for $b, c$ and for $c$, $a$, we get that $a, b, c, a$ alternate in their parities, which is clearly impossible.\n\nThus $p=2$. The original system shows that $a, b, c$ must be of the same parity. So we may divide (1) by $p^{3}$, i.e. $2^{3}$, to obtain the following product of six integer factors:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a^{k}+b^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a^{k}-b^{k}}{a-b} \\cdot \\frac{b^{k}+c^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{b^{k}-c^{k}}{b-c} \\cdot \\frac{c^{k}+a^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{c^{k}-a^{k}}{c-a}=-1\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nEach one of the factors must be equal to \\pm 1 . In particular, $a^{k}+b^{k}= \\pm 2$. If $k$ is even, this becomes $a^{k}+b^{k}=2$ and yields $|a|=|b|=1$, whence $a^{k}-b^{k}=0$, contradicting (2).\n\nLet now $k$ be odd. Then the sum $a^{k}+b^{k}$, with value \\pm 2 , has $a+b$ as a factor. Since $a$ and $b$ are of the same parity, this means that $a+b= \\pm 2$; and cyclically, $b+c= \\pm 2, c+a= \\pm 2$. In some two of these equations the signs must coincide, hence some two of $a, b, c$ are equal. This is the desired contradiction."

Then for each $i<n$ there exists a $j$ such that $a_{n}+a_{i}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. If $a_{n}+a_{i}$ is not divisible by 3 then $a_{n}+a_{i}$ divides $a_{j}$ which is impossible as $0<a_{j} \\leq a_{n}<a_{n}+a_{i}$. Thus $a_{n}+a_{i}$ is a multiple of 3 for $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$, so that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ are all congruent (to $-a_{n}$ ) modulo 3 .\n\nNow $a_{n}$ is not divisible by 3 or else so would be all remaining $a_{i}$ 's, meaning that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are not coprime. Hence $a_{n} \\equiv r(\\bmod 3)$ where $r \\in\\{1,2\\}$, and $a_{i} \\equiv 3-r(\\bmod 3)$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n\nConsider a sum $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq n-2$. There is at least one such sum as $n \\geq 3$. Let $j$ be an index such that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. Observe that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ is not divisible by 3 since $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \\equiv 2 a_{i} \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod 3)$. It follows that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ divides $a_{j}$, in particular $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \\leq a_{j}$. Hence $a_{n-1}<a_{j} \\leq a_{n}$, implying $j=n$. So $a_{n}$ is divisible by all sums $a_{n-1}+a_{i}, 1 \\leq i \\leq n-2$. In particular $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \\leq a_{n}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n-2$.\n\nLet $j$ be such that $a_{n}+a_{n-1}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. If $j \\leq n-2$ then $a_{n}+a_{n-1} \\leq 3 a_{j}<a_{j}+2 a_{n-1}$. This yields $a_{n}<a_{n-1}+a_{j}$; however $a_{n-1}+a_{j} \\leq a_{n}$ for $j \\leq n-2$. Therefore $j=n-1$ or $j=n$.\n\nFor $j=n-1$ we obtain $3 a_{n-1}=k\\left(a_{n}+a_{n-1}\\right)$ with $k$ an integer, and it is straightforward that $k=1\\left(k \\leq 0\\right.$ and $k \\geq 3$ contradict $0<a_{n-1}<a_{n} ; k=2$ leads to $\\left.a_{n-1}=2 a_{n}>a_{n-1}\\right)$.

Hence $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$ holds true in both cases remaining, $j=n-1$ and $j=n$.\n\nNow $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$ implies that the sum $a_{n-1}+a_{1}$ is strictly between $a_{n} / 2$ and $a_{n}$. But $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{1}$ are distinct as $n \\geq 3$, so it follows from the above that $a_{n-1}+a_{1}$ divides $a_{n}$. This provides the desired contradiction."

In view of the symmetry $a_{N-1-k}=a_{k}$ this sequence is a permutation of $\\left(a_{0}, a_{2}, a_{4}, \\ldots, a_{N-2}\\right)$.

Then the second formula of $(5)$ shows that $\\left(b_{2}, b_{6}, b_{10}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-2}\\right)(\\bmod N)$ is exactly the same permutation; moreover, this formula distinguishes $(\\bmod 2 N)$ each $b_{4 i}$ from $b_{4 i+2}$.\n\nConsequently, these two sequences combined represent $(\\bmod 2 N)$ a permutation of the sequence $(1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1, N+1, N+3, N+5, \\ldots, N+N-1)$, and this is precisely the induction claim.\n\nNow we prove formulas (5); we begin with the second one.

We prove that $g$ is injective too. Suppose that $g(a)=g(b)$ with $a<b$. Then $a+k_{a}=f^{2 k_{a}}(a)=f^{2 k_{b}}(b)=b+k_{b}$ implies $k_{a}>k_{b}$. So, since $f$ is injective on $S$, we obtain\n\n$$\nf^{2\\left(k_{a}-k_{b}\\right)}(a)=b=a+\\left(k_{a}-k_{b}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever this contradicts the minimality of $k_{a}$ as $0<k_{a}-k_{b}<k_{a}$.\n\nLet $T$ be the set of elements of $S$ that are not of the form $g(n)$ with $n \\in S$. Note that $1 \\in T$ by $g(n)>n$ for $n \\in S$, so $T$ is non-empty. For each $t \\in T$ denote $C_{t}=\\left\\{t, g(t), g^{2}(t), \\ldots\\right\\}$; call $C_{t}$ the chain starting at $t$. Observe that distinct chains are disjoint because $g$ is injective. Each $n \\in S \\backslash T$ has the form $n=g\\left(n^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $n^{\\prime}<n, n^{\\prime} \\in S$. Repeated applications of the same observation show that $n \\in C_{t}$ for some $t \\in T$, i. e. $S$ is the disjoint union of the chains $C_{t}$.\n\nIf $f^{n}(1)$ is in the chain $C_{t}$ starting at $t=f^{n_{t}}(1)$ then $n=n_{t}+2 a_{1}+\\cdots+2 a_{j}$ with\n\n$$\nf^{n}(1)=g^{j}\\left(f^{n_{t}}(1)\\right)=f^{2 a_{j}}\\left(f^{2 a_{j-1}}\\left(\\cdots f^{2 a_{1}}\\left(f^{n_{t}}(1)\\right)\\right)\\right)=f^{n_{t}}(1)+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{j} .\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nf^{n}(1)=f^{n_{t}}(1)+\\frac{n-n_{t}}{2}=t+\\frac{n-n_{t}}{2} .\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nNow we show that $T$ is infinite. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there are only finitely many chains $C_{t_{1}}, \\ldots, C_{t_{r}}$, starting at $t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{r}$. Fix $N$. If $f^{n}(1)$ with $1 \\leq n \\leq N$ is in $C_{t}$ then $f^{n}(1)=t+\\frac{n-n_{t}}{2} \\leq t_{r}+\\frac{N}{2}$ by (1). But then the $N+1$ distinct natural numbers $1, f(1), \\ldots, f^{N}(1)$ are all less than $t_{r}+\\frac{N}{2}$ and hence $N+1 \\leq t_{r}+\\frac{N}{2}$. This is a contradiction if $N$ is sufficiently large, and hence $T$ is infinite.\n\nTo complete the argument, choose any $k$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ and consider the $k+1$ chains starting at the first $k+1$ numbers in $T$. Let $t$ be the greatest one among these numbers. Then each of the chains in question contains a number not exceeding $t$, and at least one of them does not contain any number among $t+1, \\ldots, t+k$. So there is a number $n$ in this chain such that $g(n)-n>k$, i. e. $k_{n}>k$. In conclusion $k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots$ is unbounded."

            "We use the notation $f(x)=f\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ for $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ and $[m]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\}$. Observe that if a metapolynomial $f(x)$ admits a representation like the one in the statement for certain positive integers $m$ and $n$, then they can be replaced by any $m^{\\prime} \\geq m$ and $n^{\\prime} \\geq n$. For instance, if we want to replace $m$ by $m+1$ then it is enough to define $P_{m+1, j}(x)=P_{m, j}(x)$ and note that repeating elements of a set do not change its maximum nor its minimum. So one can assume that any two metapolynomials are defined with the same $m$ and $n$. We reserve letters $P$ and $Q$ for polynomials, so every function called $P, P_{i, j}, Q, Q_{i, j}, \\ldots$ is a polynomial function.\n\nWe start with a lemma that is useful to change expressions of the form $\\min \\max f_{i, j}$ to ones of the form $\\max \\min g_{i, j}$.\n\nLemma. Let $\\left\\{a_{i, j}\\right\\}$ be real numbers, for all $i \\in[m]$ and $j \\in[n]$. Then\n\n$$\n\\min _{i \\in[m]} \\max _{j \\in[n]} a_{i, j}=\\max _{j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{m} \\in[n]} \\min _{i \\in[m]} a_{i, j_{i}}\n$$\n\nwhere the max in the right-hand side is over all vectors $\\left(j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{m}\\right)$ with $j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{m} \\in[n]$.\n\nProof. We can assume for all $i$ that $a_{i, n}=\\max \\left\\{a_{i, 1}, \\ldots, a_{i, n}\\right\\}$ and $a_{m, n}=\\min \\left\\{a_{1, n}, \\ldots, a_{m, n}\\right\\}$. The left-hand side is $=a_{m, n}$ and hence we need to prove the same for the right-hand side. If $\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \\ldots, j_{m}\\right)=(n, n, \\ldots, n)$ then $\\min \\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\}=\\min \\left\\{a_{1, n}, \\ldots, a_{m, n}\\right\\}=a_{m, n}$ which implies that the right-hand side is $\\geq a_{m, n}$. It remains to prove the opposite inequality and this is equivalent to $\\min \\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\} \\leq a_{m, n}$ for all possible $\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \\ldots, j_{m}\\right)$. This is true because $\\min \\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\} \\leq a_{m, j_{m}} \\leq a_{m, n}$.\n\nWe need to show that the family $\\mathcal{M}$ of metapolynomials is closed under multiplication, but it turns out easier to prove more: that it is also closed under addition, maxima and minima.\n\nFirst we prove the assertions about the maxima and the minima. If $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}$ are metapolynomials, assume them defined with the same $m$ and $n$. Then\n\n$$\nf=\\max \\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right\\}=\\max \\left\\{\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{1}, \\ldots, \\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{r}\\right\\}=\\max _{s \\in[r], i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{s}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $f=\\max \\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right\\}$ is a metapolynomial. The same argument works for the minima, but first we have to replace $\\min \\max$ by $\\max \\min$, and this is done via the lemma.\n\nAnother property we need is that if $f=\\max \\min P_{i, j}$ is a metapolynomial then so is $-f$. Indeed, $-f=\\min \\left(-\\min P_{i, j}\\right)=\\min \\max P_{i, j}$.\n\nTo prove $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under addition let $f=\\max \\min P_{i, j}$ and $g=\\max \\min Q_{i, j}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(x)+g(x)=\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}(x)+\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} Q_{i, j}(x) \\\\\n=\\max _{i_{1}, i_{2} \\in[m]}\\left(\\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i_{1}, j}(x)+\\min _{j \\in[n]} Q_{i_{2}, j}(x)\\right)=\\max _{i_{1}, i_{2} \\in[m]} \\min _{j_{1}, j_{2} \\in[n]}\\left(P_{i_{1}, j_{1}}(x)+Q_{i_{2}, j_{2}}(x)\\right),\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nand hence $f(x)+g(x)$ is a metapolynomial.\n\nWe proved that $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under sums, maxima and minima, in particular any function that can be expressed by sums, max, min, polynomials or even metapolynomials is in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nWe would like to proceed with multiplication along the same lines like with addition, but there is an essential difference. In general the product of the maxima of two sets is not equal\n\n\n\nto the maximum of the product of the sets. We need to deal with the fact that $a<b$ and $c<d$ do not imply $a c<b d$. However this is true for $a, b, c, d \\geq 0$.\n\nIn view of this we decompose each function $f(x)$ into its positive part $f^{+}(x)=\\max \\{f(x), 0\\}$ and its negative part $f^{-}(x)=\\max \\{0,-f(x)\\}$ . Note that $f=f^{+}-f^{-}$ and $f^{+}, f^{-} \\in \\mathcal{M}$ if $f \\in \\mathcal{M}$. The whole problem reduces to the claim that if $f$ and $g$ are metapolynomials with $f, g \\geq 0$ then $f g$ it is also a metapolynomial.\n\nAssuming this claim, consider arbitrary $f, g \\in \\mathcal{M}$. We have\n\n$$\nf g=\\left(f^{+}-f^{-}\\right)\\left(g^{+}-g^{-}\\right)=f^{+} g^{+}-f^{+} g^{-}-f^{-} g^{+}+f^{-} g^{-},\n$$\n\nand hence $f g \\in \\mathcal{M}$. Indeed, $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under addition, also $f^{+} g^{+}, f^{+} g^{-}, f^{-} g^{+}, f^{-} g^{-} \\in \\mathcal{M}$ because $f^{+}, f^{-}, g^{+}, g^{-} \\geq 0$.\n\nIt remains to prove the claim. In this case $f, g \\geq 0$, and one can try to repeat the argument for the sum. More precisely, let $f=\\max \\min P_{i j} \\geq 0$ and $g=\\max \\min Q_{i j} \\geq 0$. Then\n\n$$\nf g=\\max \\min P_{i, j} \\cdot \\max \\min Q_{i, j}=\\max \\min P_{i, j}^{+} \\cdot \\max \\min Q_{i, j}^{+}=\\max \\min P_{i_{1}, j_{1}}^{+} \\cdot Q_{i_{2}, j_{2}}^{+}\n$$\n\nHence it suffices to check that $P^{+} Q^{+} \\in \\mathcal{M}$ for any pair of polynomials $P$ and $Q$. This reduces to the identity\n\n$$\nu^{+} v^{+}=\\max \\left\\{0, \\min \\{u v, u, v\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, u^{2} v\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u, u^{2} v\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, v\\right\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwith $u$ replaced by $P(x)$ and $v$ replaced by $Q(x)$. The formula is proved by a case-by-case analysis. If $u \\leq 0$ or $v \\leq 0$ then both sides equal 0 . In case $u, v \\geq 0$, the right-hand side is clearly $\\leq u v$. To prove the opposite inequality we use that $u v$ equals\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\min \\{u v, u, v\\} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq u, v \\leq 1 \\\\\n\\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, u^{2} v\\right\\} & \\text { if } 1 \\leq u, v \\\\\n\\min \\left\\{u v, u, u^{2} v\\right\\} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq v \\leq 1 \\leq u, \\\\\n\\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, v\\right\\} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq u \\leq 1 \\leq v .\n\\end{array}\n$$"

Take a permutation $\\pi$ of the tokens which moves A-tokens to B-tokens, B-tokens to C-tokens, and C-tokens to A-tokens, in each case to a distance at most $d$. For each A-square $S$, and for each A-token $T$, connect $S$ and $T$ by an edge if $T, \\pi(T)$ or $\\pi^{-1}(T)$ is on the trimino containing $S$.

Let $S$ be an arbitrary A-square, and let $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}$ be the three tokens on the trimino containing $S$.

            "The proof is based on the following general fact.\n\nLemma. In a graph $G$ each vertex $v$ has degree $d_{v}$. Then $G$ contains an independent set $S$ of vertices such that $|S| \\geq f(G)$ where\n\n$$\nf(G)=\\sum_{v \\in G} \\frac{1}{d_{v}+1}\n$$\n\nProof. Induction on $n=|G|$. The base $n=1$ is clear. For the inductive step choose a vertex $v_{0}$ in $G$ of minimum degree $d$. Delete $v_{0}$ and all of its neighbors $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{d}$ and also all edges with endpoints $v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{d}$. This gives a new graph $G^{\\prime}$. By the inductive assumption $G^{\\prime}$ contains an independent set $S^{\\prime}$ of vertices such that $\\left|S^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq f\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$. Since no vertex in $S^{\\prime}$ is a neighbor of $v_{0}$ in $G$, the set $S=S^{\\prime} \\cup\\left\\{v_{0}\\right\\}$ is independent in $G$.\n\nLet $d_{v}^{\\prime}$ be the degree of a vertex $v$ in $G^{\\prime}$. Clearly $d_{v}^{\\prime} \\leq d_{v}$ for every such vertex $v$, and also $d_{v_{i}} \\geq d$ for all $i=0,1, \\ldots, d$ by the minimal choice of $v_{0}$. Therefore\n\n$$\nf\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sum_{v \\in G^{\\prime}} \\frac{1}{d_{v}^{\\prime}+1} \\geq \\sum_{v \\in G^{\\prime}} \\frac{1}{d_{v}+1}=f(G)-\\sum_{i=0}^{d} \\frac{1}{d_{v_{i}}+1} \\geq f(G)-\\frac{d+1}{d+1}=f(G)-1 .\n$$\n\nHence $|S|=\\left|S^{\\prime}\\right|+1 \\geq f\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)+1 \\geq f(G)$, and the induction is complete.\n\nWe pass on to our problem. For clarity denote $n=2^{499}$ and draw all chords determined by the given $2 n$ points. Color each chord with one of the colors $3,4, \\ldots, 4 n-1$ according to the sum of the numbers at its endpoints. Chords with a common endpoint have different colors. For each color $c$ consider the following graph $G_{c}$. Its vertices are the chords of color $c$, and two chords are neighbors in $G_{c}$ if they intersect. Let $f\\left(G_{c}\\right)$ have the same meaning as in the lemma for all graphs $G_{c}$.\n\nEvery chord $\\ell$ divides the circle into two arcs, and one of them contains $m(\\ell) \\leq n-1$ given points. (In particular $m(\\ell)=0$ if $\\ell$ joins two consecutive points.) For each $i=0,1, \\ldots, n-2$ there are $2 n$ chords $\\ell$ with $m(\\ell)=i$. Such a chord has degree at most $i$ in the respective graph. Indeed let $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{i}$ be all points on either arc determined by a chord $\\ell$ with $m(\\ell)=i$ and color $c$. Every $A_{j}$ is an endpoint of at most 1 chord colored $c, j=1, \\ldots, i$. Hence at most $i$ chords of color $c$ intersect $\\ell$.\n\nIt follows that for each $i=0,1, \\ldots, n-2$ the $2 n$ chords $\\ell$ with $m(\\ell)=i$ contribute at least $\\frac{2 n}{i+1}$ to the sum $\\sum_{c} f\\left(G_{c}\\right)$. Summation over $i=0,1, \\ldots, n-2$ gives\n\n$$\n\\sum_{c} f\\left(G_{c}\\right) \\geq 2 n \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i}\n$$\n\nBecause there are $4 n-3$ colors in all, averaging yields a color $c$ such that\n\n$$\nf\\left(G_{c}\\right) \\geq \\frac{2 n}{4 n-3} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i}>\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i}\n$$\n\nBy the lemma there are at least $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i}$ pairwise disjoint chords of color $c$, i. e. with the same sum $c$ of the pairs of numbers at their endpoints. It remains to show that $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i} \\geq 100$ for $n=2^{499}$. Indeed we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i}>\\sum_{i=1}^{2^{400}} \\frac{1}{i}=1+\\sum_{k=1}^{400} \\sum_{i=2^{k-1+1}}^{2^{k}} \\frac{1}{i}>1+\\sum_{k=1}^{400} \\frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k}}=201>200\n$$\n\nThis completes the solution."

If $A B C$ is an equilateral triangle then the equalities (*) imply that $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}, I, O$ and $P$ coincide, so $O P=O I$. Otherwise at most one of $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ coincides with $I$. If say $C^{\\prime}=I$ then $O I \\perp C I$ by the previous reasoning. It follows that $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime} \\neq I$ and hence $A^{\\prime} \\neq B^{\\prime}$. Finally $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}$ and $I$ are noncollinear because $I, A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ are concyclic."

The strategy of the proof is to construct a point $Q$ with the same power with respect to the four circles. Then each of $P$ and $Q$ has the same power with respect to $\\omega_{A}, \\omega_{B}, \\omega_{C}$ and hence the three circles are coaxial. In other words they have another common point $P^{\\prime}$ or the three of them are tangent at $P$.\n\nWe first give a description of the point $Q$. Let $A^{\\prime} \\neq A$ be the second intersection of $\\omega$ and $\\omega_{A}$; define $B^{\\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime}$ analogously. We claim that $A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}$ and $C C^{\\prime}$ have a common point.

Observe that $X^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}, Z^{\\prime}$ do exist. If $A A^{\\prime}$ is parallel to $\\ell$ then $\\omega_{A}$ is tangent to $\\ell$; hence $X=P$ which is a contradiction.

To avoid distracting remarks we interpret everything projectively, i. e. whenever two lines are parallel they meet at a point on the line at infinity.\n\n\n\nLet $U, V, W$ be the intersections of $A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}, C C^{\\prime}$ with $B C, C A, A B$ respectively. The idea is that although it is difficult to calculate the ratio $\\frac{B U}{C U}$, it is easier to deal with the cross-ratio $\\frac{B U}{C U} / \\frac{B X}{C X}$ because we can send it to the line $\\ell$. With this in mind we apply MENELAUs' theorem to the triangle $A B C$ and obtain $\\frac{B X}{C X} \\cdot \\frac{C Y}{A Y} \\cdot \\frac{A Z}{B Z}=1$. Hence Ceva's ratio can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\frac{B U}{C U} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W}=\\frac{B U}{C U} / \\frac{B X}{C X} \\cdot \\frac{C V}{A V} / \\frac{C Y}{A Y} \\cdot \\frac{A W}{B W} / \\frac{A Z}{B Z}\n$$\n\n<img_3503>\n\nProject the line $B C$ to $\\ell$ from $A$.

For instance, the transformation $t \\mapsto-k^{2} / t$ preserves cross-ratio and interchanges the points $X, Y, Z$ with the points $X^{\\prime}, Y^{\\prime}, Z^{\\prime}$.

The lines in $\\Pi$ are taken to circles through $O$, and the circles in $\\Pi$ also are taken to circles on $\\Pi^{\\prime}$.\n\n<img_3897>\n\nSince the line $\\ell$ and the circle $\\omega$ are perpendicular to the plane $O P Q$, the circles $\\ell^{\\prime}$ and $\\omega^{\\prime}$ also are perpendicular to this plane.

Hence, the lines $O X^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ are coplanar. Moreover, they lie in the parallel planes of $\\ell^{\\prime}$ and $\\omega^{\\prime}$. Therefore, $O X^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ are parallel. Analogously, $O Y^{\\prime}$ and $O Z^{\\prime}$ are parallel to $A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet $A_{1}$ be the second intersection of the circles $A^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}$ and $\\omega^{\\prime}$, other than $A^{\\prime}$. The segments $A^{\\prime} A_{1}$ and $P^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}$ are coplanar, and therefore parallel. Now we know that $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $A^{\\prime} A_{1}$ are parallel to $O X^{\\prime}$ and $X^{\\prime} P^{\\prime}$ respectively, but these two segments are perpendicular because $O P^{\\prime}$ is a diameter in $\\ell^{\\prime}$. We found that $A^{\\prime} A_{1}$ and $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ are perpendicular, hence $A^{\\prime} A_{1}$ is the altitude in the triangle $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$, starting from $A$.\n\nAnalogously, let $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ be the second intersections of $\\omega^{\\prime}$ with the circles $B^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime} P^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$, other than $B^{\\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime}$ respectively.

(a) For each residue class $r$ there exist exactly $s_{r}$ pairs $(a, b)$ with $a^{2}+b^{5} \\equiv r$ and $s_{r}$ pairs $(c, d)$ with $c^{2}+d^{5} \\equiv r$.

Now suppose $b^{5} \\not \\equiv d^{5}$. In this case $a$ and $c$ must be distinct. By $(a-c)(a+c)=d^{5}-b^{5}$, the value of $a-c$ uniquely determines $a+c$ and thus $a$ and $c$ as well. Hence, there are $p-1$ suitable pairs $(a, c)$.\n\nThus, for each of the $k$ pairs $(b, d)$ with $b^{5} \\equiv d^{5}$ there are $2 p-1$ pairs $(a, c)$, and for each of the other $p^{2}-k$ pairs $(b, d)$ there are $p-1$ pairs $(a, c)$.

Let $T=\\left\\{x^{10}: x \\in \\mathcal{P} \\backslash\\{0\\}\\right\\}$ be the set of nonzero 10th powers modulo $p$.

Any line segment in $g$ cuts a region determined by the $n$ lines in two, and since we switched colors on one side of $g$ this segment will also lie between two regions of different color.\n\nNow without loss of generality we may assume, that Turbo starts on a line segment with a white region on her left and a black one on her right. At any intersection, if she turns right, she will keep the black tile to her right. If she turns left, she will keep the white tile to her left. Thus wherever she goes, she will always have a white tile on her left and a black tile on her right. As a consequence, she can cross every line segment only in the direction where she has a white tile to her left, and never the opposite direction where she would have a black tile to the left.",
            "Suppose the assumption is true.\n\nLet's label each segment in the snail's path with $\\mathbf{L}$ or $\\mathbf{R}$ depending on the direction that Turbo chose at the start point of this segment (one segment can have several labels if it has been visited several times).\n\nConsider the first segment that has been visited twice in different directions, name this segment $s_{1}$. Assume without loss of generality that it is labeled with $\\mathbf{L}$. Then next segment must be labeled with $\\mathbf{R}$, name this one $s_{2}$.\n\nLet's look at the label which $s_{1}$ can get on the second visit. If it gets $\\mathbf{L}$ then the previous segment in the path must be $s_{2}$. But in this case $s_{1}$ is not the first segment that has been visited twice in different directions because $s_{2}$ has been visited earlier. So the second label of $s_{1}$ must be $\\mathbf{R}$, and Turbo must have come from the opposite side of $s_{2}$.\n\n<img_3799>\n\n\n\nSince Turbo alters directions at each point, labels in her path also alter. And because two labels of $s_{1}$ are different, the number of visited segments between these two visits must be even.\n\nNow let's make the following observation: each segment in the path corresponds to exactly one line, and its previous and next segments are on opposite sides of this line.\n\n<img_3145>\n\nAgain consider the path between two visits of $s_{1}$.\n\nEach line intersecting this path must be crossed an even number of times because Turbo has to return to the initial side of each line. Therefore, an even number of segments of Turbo's path are contained on each of these lines. But the line containing $s_{1}$ must be crossed an odd number times. Since each crossing corresponds to exactly one segment in the path, the number of segments must be odd.\n\nHere we get the contradiction. Therefore, the assumption is false.",
            "Suppose that the snail always slides slightly to the right of the line segments on her path. When turning to the right, she does not cross any line, whereas when turning to the left, she crosses exactly two lines. This means that at any time of her journey, she has crossed an even number of lines.\n\nAssuming that at some point she slides along a segment for the second time, but in the opposite direction, we argue that she needs to cross an odd number of lines. Let $\\ell$ be the line on which the revisit happens. In order to get to the other side of $\\ell$, the snail has to cross $\\ell$ an odd number of times. To visit the same segment of $\\ell$, she must cross every other line an even number of times.",
            "Let us color in red all intersection points of the given lines and let us choose one of two possible directions on each segment (draw an arrow on each segment). Consider a red point $R$ where two given lines $a$ and $b$ meet, and the four segments $a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}$ with endpoint $R$ (so that $a_{i} \\subset a, b_{j} \\subset b$ ). $R$ is called a saddle if on $a_{1}, a_{2}$ the arrows go out of $R$ while on $b_{1}, b_{2}$ the arrows enter $R$, or visa versa, on $b_{1}, b_{2}$ the arrows go out of $R$ while on $a_{1}, a_{2}$ the arrows enter $R$. The set of arrows (chosen on all segments) is said to be good if all red points are saddles. It is sufficient to prove that there exists a good set of arrows. Indeed, if initially Turbo is moving along (or opposite) the arrow, then this condition holds after she turns at a red point.\n\nThe given lines cut the plane into regions. Further we need the following property of the good set of arrows (this property directly follows from the definition): the boundary of any bounded region is a directed cycle of arrows; the boundary of any unbounded region is a directed chain of arrows.\n\nWe construct a good set of arrows by induction on $n$ with trivial base $n=1$. Now erase one of $n$ given lines and assume we have a good set of arrows for remaining $n-1$ lines. Now restore the $n$-th line $\\ell$, assume that $\\ell$ is horizontal. Denote by $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ all new red points on $\\ell$ from the left to the right. Each of $A_{i}$ belongs to some old segment $m_{i}$ of the line $\\ell_{i}$. Let us call $A_{i}$ ascending if the arrow on $m_{i}$ goes up, and descending if the arrow on $m_{i}$ goes down. Consider the region containing the segment $A_{i} A_{i+1}$. By the property, $A_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}$ can not be both ascending or both descending. Thus we can choose arrows on all pieces of $\\ell$ so that each arrow goes from a descending to an ascending vertex.\n\n\n\nEach of points $A_{i}$ cuts $m_{i}$ into two new pieces; the direction of new pieces supposed to be the same as on $m_{i}$. Now simultaneously change the direction of arrows on all pieces below the line $\\ell$. It is easy to see that $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ become saddles, while the other red points remain saddles.

The key observation (a rotation centered at $M$ sends $\\triangle X Y Z$ to $\\triangle R Q P$ ) can be established in slightly different ways.

Moreover, $s$ is a rotation, since $M$ is equidistant from $X Z$ and $R Q$.\n\nRemark. The reverse argument can be derived in a different way, e.g., defining $N$ as the common point of the circles $B X P D, D Y Q F, F Z R B$, and showing that $\\triangle N X Z=\\triangle N P R$, etc.\n\n\n\n<img_3291>",

We will prove that they coincide by finding two distinct points $A^{\\prime}, A^{\\prime \\prime} \\in a$ for which $s\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $s\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. Then we will obtain that $s(A)=t(A)$, which by construction implies that the bisectors of $\\angle B, \\angle D$ and $\\angle F$ are concurrent.\n\nWe will choose $A^{\\prime}$ to be the reflection of $C$ in $e$ and $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ to be the reflection of $E$ in $c$. They are distinct since otherwise $C$ and $E$ would be symmetric in $a$. Applying the above maps $a \\rightarrow B C$ and $a \\rightarrow E F$ to $A^{\\prime}$, we get points $B^{\\prime}$ and $F^{\\prime}$ such that $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C D E F^{\\prime}$ satisfies the problem statement. However, this hexagon is symmetric in $e$, hence the bisectors of $\\angle B^{\\prime}, \\angle D, \\angle F^{\\prime}$ are concurrent and $s\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)$. The same reasoning yields $s\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$, which finishes the solution.\n\nRemark. This solution is based on the fact that that two specific affine linear maps coincide. Here it was proved by exhibiting two points where they coincide. One could prove it in another way, exhibiting one such point and proving that the 'slopes' are equal.\n\nRemark. There are similar solutions where claims and proofs could be presented in more 'elementary' terms. For example, an elementary reformulation of the 'slopes' being equal is: if $b^{\\prime}$ passes through $B^{\\prime}$ parallel to $b$, and $f^{\\prime}$ passes through $F^{\\prime}$ parallel to $f$, then the line through $b \\cap f$ and $b^{\\prime} \\cap f^{\\prime}$ is parallel to $a$ (which is parallel to $d$ ).\n\nRemark. Circles $\\omega_{a}, \\omega_{c}$ and $\\omega_{e}$ could be helpful in some other solutions. In particular, the movement of $A$ along $a$ in current solution is equivalent to varying $r_{a}$.",
            "We use the same notations as in previous solutions.\n\nSince the sum of the angles of a convex hexagon is $720^{\\circ}$, from the angle conditions we get $\\angle B+\\angle C=720^{\\circ} / 3=240^{\\circ}$. From $\\angle B+\\angle C=240^{\\circ}$ it follows that the angle between $c$ and $b$ equals $60^{\\circ}$. The same is analogously true for other pairs of bisectors of neighboring angles.\n\nConsider the points $O_{a} \\in a, O_{c} \\in c, O_{e} \\in e$, each at the same distance $d^{\\prime}$ from $M$, where $d^{\\prime}>\\max \\{M A, M C, M E\\}$, and such that the rays $A O_{a}, C O_{c}, E O_{e}$ point out of the hexagon.

It follows that rays $O_{a} B_{a}$ and $O_{c} B_{c}$ (being symmetrical in $e$ ) intersect at $U_{e} \\in e$ forming an isosceles triangle $\\triangle O_{a} U_{e} O_{c}$. Similarly define $\\triangle O_{c} U_{a} O_{e}$ and $\\triangle O_{e} U_{c} O_{a}$. These triangles are congruent (equal bases and corresponding angles).

Moreover, we also have $B_{a} U_{e}=O_{a} U_{e}-r_{a}=O_{a} U_{c}-r_{a}=F_{a} U_{c}=x$, and thus similarly $D_{c} U_{a}=B_{c} U_{e}=y$, $F_{e} U_{c}=D_{e} U_{a}=z$.\n\nNow from quadrilateral $B B_{a} U_{e} B_{c}$ with two opposite right angles $B_{a} B^{2}-B_{c} B^{2}=B_{c} U_{e}^{2}-B_{a} U_{e}^{2}=$ $y^{2}-x^{2}$.

The midpoint of $B P$ therefore has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\sin (2 \\beta)\\right)$, so $D$ and $E$ have $x$-coordinate $\\frac{1}{2}$.

To show that $P$ is the incenter of $C D E$, we will show that $P$ lies on the bisector of $\\angle C D E$; analogously, one can show that $P$ lies on the bisector of angle $C E D$. The bisector of angle $C D E$ passes through the midpoint $M$ of the arc $C E$ not containing $D E$; because $C=f\\left(180^{\\circ}-4 \\beta\\right)$ and $E=f\\left(-60^{\\circ}\\right)$, we have $M=f\\left(240^{\\circ}-2 \\beta\\right)$.\n\nIt remains to show that $P=(1-\\cos (2 \\beta), \\sin (2 \\beta))$ lies on the line connecting the points $D=$ $\\left(\\cos \\left(60^{\\circ}\\right), \\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)$ and $M=\\left(\\cos \\left(240^{\\circ}-2 \\beta\\right), \\sin \\left(240^{\\circ}-2 \\beta\\right)\\right)=\\left(-\\cos \\left(60^{\\circ}-2 \\beta\\right),-\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}-2 \\beta\\right)\\right)$.

We claim that the total weight decreases after any move of the contestants. Indeed, let us assume that $C_{i}$ moves forward in the queue, let $\\sigma$ be the permutation before the move, and let $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ denote the permutation after the move. Since $C_{i}$ jumps over exactly $i$ contestants, necessarily she jumps over at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with index\n\n\n\n$j>i$. This means that the pair $(i, j)$ is reverse with respect to $\\sigma$ but not with respect to $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, and this yields a reduction of $2^{i}$ in the total weight.

Then necessarily $C_{i_{0}}$ jumps infinitely many times over some fixed $C_{j_{0}}$ with $j_{0}>i_{0}$. On the other hand, we know that $C_{j_{0}}$ makes only a finite number of moves, and therefore she can precede $C_{i_{0}}$ in the line only a finite number of times, which is absurd.\n\nIn order to estimate from above the maximal number of moves, we show that the contestant $C_{i}$ can make at most $2^{n-i}-1$ moves. Indeed, let us argue by \"backward extended induction\".

When $C_{i-1}$ moves, at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with $j>i-1$ must precede her in the line. The initial configuration can provide at most $n-i$ contestants with larger index in front of $C_{i-1}$, which means at most $n-i$ moves for $C_{i-1}$. All other moves are possible only if some contestant in the range $C_{i}, C_{i+1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ jumps over $C_{i-1}$ during her moves.

By applying the lemma, we see that $E_{01}+E_{02} \\equiv C_{0} \\bmod 2$.\n\n$$\n\\text { Similarly } E_{01}+E_{12} \\equiv C_{1}, \\quad \\text { and } E_{02}+E_{12} \\equiv C_{2}, \\quad \\bmod 2 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that $C_{0}=C_{1}=2019$ and $C_{2}=0$, we deduce that either $E_{02}$ and $E_{12}$ are even and $E_{01}$ is odd; or $E_{02}$ and $E_{12}$ are odd and $E_{01}$ is even.\n\nBut if the edge labels are the first $N$ non-negative integers, then $E_{01}=E_{12}$ unless $N \\equiv 0$ modulo 3 , in which case $E_{01}=E_{02}$. So however Alina chooses the vertex labels, it is not possible that the multiset of edge labels is $\\{0, \\ldots, N\\}$.\n\nHence in fact two vertex labels must differ by a multiple of 3 .",
            "As before, colour vertices based on their label modulo 3.\n\nSuppose this gives a valid 3-colouring of the graph with 2019 0s and 2019 1s on the circumference. Identify pairs of 0-labelled vertices and pairs of 1-labelled vertices on the circumference, with one 0 and one 1 left over. The resulting graph has even degrees except these two leaves. So the connected component $\\mathcal{C}$ containing these leaves has an Eulerian path, and any other component has an Eulerian cycle.\n\nLet $E_{01}^{*}$ denote the number of edges between 0 -vertices and 1-vertices in $\\mathcal{C}$, and let $E_{01}^{\\prime}$ denote the number of such edges in the other components, and so on. By studying whether a given vertex has label congruent to 0 modulo 3 or not as we go along the Eulerian path in $\\mathcal{C}$, we find $E_{01}^{*}+E_{02}^{*}$ is odd, and similarly $E_{01}^{*}+E_{12}^{*}$ is odd. Since neither start nor end vertex is a 2 -vertex, $E_{02}^{*}+E_{12}^{*}$ must be even.\n\nApplying the same argument for the Eulerian cycle in each other component and adding up, we find that $E_{01}^{\\prime}+E_{02}^{\\prime}, E_{01}^{\\prime}+E_{12}^{\\prime}, E_{02}^{\\prime}+E_{12}^{\\prime}$ are all even. So, again we find $E_{01}+E_{02}$, $E_{01}+E_{12}$ are odd, and $E_{02}+E_{12}$ is even, and we finish as in the original solution."

Let $F$ be the intersection of the lines $A^{\\prime} D$ and $B^{\\prime} C$. Finally, let $G$ be the intesection of $X Y$ and $Z W$.\n\nNow we use Pascal's theorem five times:\n\n1. From $B D D^{\\prime} C A A^{\\prime}$ we see that the points $P, W$ and $E$ are collinear.\n2. From $B B^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} C C^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ we see that the points $Y, O$ and $E$ are collinear.\n3. From $B^{\\prime} B D A^{\\prime} A C$ we see that the points $X, P$ and $F$ are collinear.\n4. From $B^{\\prime} D^{\\prime} D A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} C$ we see that the points $O, Z$ and $F$ are collinear.\n5. From $D^{\\prime} C B^{\\prime} B A^{\\prime} D$ we see that the points $E, F$ and $G$ are collinear.\n\nSo the opposite sides of the hexagon $P X Y O Z W$ intersect at points $F, G$ and $E$, which are collinear, so by the converse of Pascal's theorem the points $X, Y, Z, W, P$ and $O$ indeed lie on a conic section."

On each of 16 consecutive days, some of the dwarves worked in the diamond mine while the remaining dwarves collected berries in the forest. No dwarf performed both types of work on the same day. On any two different (not necessarily consecutive) days, at least three dwarves each performed both types of work. Further, on the first day, all seven dwarves worked in the diamond mine.\n\nProve that, on one of these 16 days, all seven dwarves were collecting berries.",
        "solution": [
            "We define $V$ as the set of all 128 vectors of length 7 with entries in $\\{0,1\\}$. Every such vector encodes the work schedule of a single day: if the $i$-th entry is 0 then the $i$-th dwarf works in the mine, and if this entry is 1 then the $i$-th dwarf collects berries. The 16 working days correspond to 16 vectors $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{16}$ in $V$, which we will call dayvectors. The condition imposed on any pair of distinct days means that any two distinct day-vectors $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ differ in at least three positions.\n\nWe say that a vector $x \\in V$ covers some vector $y \\in V$, if $x$ and $y$ differ in at most one position; note that every vector in $V$ covers exactly eight vectors. For each of the 16 day-vectors $d_{i}$ we define $B_{i} \\subset V$ as the set of the eight vectors that are covered by $d_{i}$. As, for $i \\neq j$, the day-vectors $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ differ in at least three positions, their corresponding sets $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are disjoint. As the sets $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{16}$ together contain $16 \\cdot 8=128=|V|$ distinct elements, they form a partition of $V$; in other words, every vector in $V$ is covered by precisely one day-vector.\n\nThe weight of a vector $v \\in V$ is defined as the number of 1-entries in $v$. For $k=0,1, \\ldots, 7$, the set $V$ contains $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}7 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ vectors of weight $k$. Let us analyse the 16 dayvectors $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{16}$ by their weights, and let us discuss how the vectors in $V$ are covered by them.\n\n1. As all seven dwarves work in the diamond mine on the first day, the first day-vector is $d_{1}=(0000000)$. This day-vector covers all vectors in $V$ with weight 0 or 1.\n2. No day-vector can have weight 2 , as otherwise it would differ from $d_{1}$ in at most two positions. Hence each of the $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}7 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=21$ vectors of weight 2 must be covered by some day-vector of weight 3 . As every vector of weight 3 covers three vectors of weight 2 , exactly $21 / 3=7$ day-vectors have weight 3 .\n3. How are the $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}7 \\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right)=35$ vectors of weight 3 covered by the day-vectors? Seven of them are day-vectors, and the remaining 28 ones must be covered by day-vectors of weight 4 . As every vector of weight 4 covers four vectors of weight 3 , exactly $28 / 4=7$ day-vectors have weight 4.\n\n\nTo summarize, one day-vector has weight 0 , seven have weight 3 , and seven have weight 4 . None of these 15 day-vectors covers any vector of weight 6 or 7 , so that the eight heavyweight vectors in $V$ must be covered by the only remaining day-vector; and this remaining vector must be (1111111). On the day corresponding to (1111111) all seven dwarves are collecting berries, and that is what we wanted to show.",
            "If a dwarf $X$ performs the same type of work on three days $D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}$, then we say that this triple of days is monotonous for $X$. We claim that the following configuration cannot occur: There are three dwarves $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ and three days $D_{1}, D_{2}$, $D_{3}$, such that the triple $\\left(D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}\\right)$ is monotonous for each of the dwarves $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$.\n\n(Proof: Suppose that such a configuration occurs. Then among the remaining dwarves there exist three dwarves $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}$ that performed both types of work on day $D_{1}$ and on day $D_{2}$; without loss of generality these three dwarves worked in the mine on day $D_{1}$ and collected berries on day $D_{2}$. On day $D_{3}$, two of $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}$ performed the same type of work, and without loss of generality $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ worked in the mine. But then on days $D_{1}$ and $D_{3}$, each of the five dwarves $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, Y_{1}, Y_{2}$ performed only one type of work; this is in contradiction with the problem statement.)\n\nNext we consider some fixed triple $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ of dwarves. There are eight possible working schedules for $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ (like mine-mine-mine, mine-mine-berries, mine-berriesmine, etc). As the above forbidden configuration does not occur, each of these eight working schedules must occur on exactly two of the sixteen days. In particular this implies that every dwarf worked exactly eight times in the mine and exactly eight times in the forest.\n\nFor $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant 7$ we denote by $d(k)$ the number of days on which exactly $k$ dwarves were collecting berries. Since on the first day all seven dwarves were in the mine, on each of the remaining days at least three dwarves collected berries. This yields $d(0)=1$ and $d(1)=d(2)=0$. We assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $d(7)=0$ and hence\n\n$$\nd(3)+d(4)+d(5)+d(6)=15 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nAs every dwarf collected berries exactly eight times, we get that, further,\n\n$$\n3 d(3)+4 d(4)+5 d(5)+6 d(6)=7 \\cdot 8=56 .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNext, let us count the number $q$ of quadruples $\\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, D\\right)$ for which $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ are three pairwise distinct dwarves that all collected berries on day $D$. As there are $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5=210$ triples of pairwise distinct dwarves, and as every working schedule for three fixed dwarves occurs on exactly two days, we get $q=420$. As every day on which $k$ dwarves collect berries contributes $k(k-1)(k-2)$ such quadruples, we also have\n\n$$\n3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot d(3)+4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot d(4)+5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot d(5)+6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot d(6)=q=420\n$$\n\n\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$\nd(3)+4 d(4)+10 d(5)+20 d(6)=70 \\tag{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we count the number $r$ of quadruples $\\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, D\\right)$ for which $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ are three pairwise distinct dwarves that all worked in the mine on day $D$. Similarly as above we see that $r=420$ and that\n\n$$\n7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot d(0)+4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot d(3)+3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot d(4)=r=420 \n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$\n4 d(3)+d(4)=35 \\tag{4}\n$$\n\nMultiplying (1) by -40 , multiplying (2) by 10 , multiplying (3) by -1 , multiplying (4) by 4 , and then adding up the four resulting equations yields $5 d(3)=30$ and hence $d(3)=6$. Then (4) yields $d(4)=11$. As $d(3)+d(4)=17$, the total number of days cannot be 16 . We have reached the desired contradiction."

            "First, we consider the difference $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}$. If $k=a s+b$ as in the problem statement, then $k^{\\prime}=b s+a$. We write $a=l s+m$ with $m, l$ non-negative numbers and $m \\leq s-1$. This gives $k^{\\prime \\prime}=m s+(b+l)$ and hence $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}=(a-m) s-l=l\\left(s^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nWe conclude\n\nFact 1.1. $k \\geq k^{\\prime \\prime}$ for every every $k \\geq 1$\n\nFact 1.2. $s^{2}-1$ divides the difference $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nFact 1.2 implies that the sequences $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \\ldots$ and $d_{2}, d_{4}, d_{6}, \\ldots$ are constant modulo $s^{2}-1$. Moreover, Fact 1.1 says that the sequences are (weakly) decreasing and hence eventually constant. In other words, the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\ldots$ is 2 -periodic modulo $s^{2}-1$ (from the start) and is eventually 2-periodic.\n\nNow, assume that some term in the sequence is equal to 1 . The next term is equal to $1^{\\prime}=s$ and since the sequence is 2 -periodic from the start modulo $s^{2}-1$, we conclude that $d_{1}$ is either equal to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. This proves the first implication.\n\nTo prove the other direction, assume that $d_{1}$ is congruent to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. We need the observation that once one of the sequences $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \\ldots$ or $d_{2}, d_{4}, d_{6}, \\ldots$ stabilises, then their value is less than $s^{2}$. This is implied by the following fact.\n\nFact 1.3. If $k=k^{\\prime \\prime}$, then $k=k^{\\prime \\prime}<s^{2}$.\n\nProof. We use the expression for $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}$ found before. If $k=k^{\\prime \\prime}$, then $l=0$, and so $k^{\\prime \\prime}=m s+b$. Both $m$ and $b$ are reminders after division by $s$, so they are both $\\leq s-1$. This gives $k^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq(s-1) s+(s-1)<s^{2}$.\n\nUsing Fact 1.2, it follows that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \\ldots$ is constant to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$ and stabilises to 1 or $s$ by Fact 1.3. Since $s^{\\prime}=1$, we conclude that the sequence contains a 1.",
            "We make a number of initial observations. Let $k$ be a positive integer.\n\nFact 2.1. If $k \\geq s^{2}$, then $k^{\\prime}<k$.\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k \\geq s^{2}$, then $a \\geq s$ because $b<s$. So, $k^{\\prime}=b s+a \\leq(s-1) s+a \\leq a s \\leq a s+b=k$. Moreover, we cannot have equality since that would imply $s-1=b=0$.\n\nFact 2.2. If $k \\leq s^{2}-1$, then $k^{\\prime} \\leq s^{2}-1$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=k$.\n\n\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k<s^{2}$, then it must hold $1 \\leq a, b<s$, hence $k^{\\prime}=b s+a<s^{2}$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=(b s+a)^{\\prime}=a s+b=k$.\n\nFact 2.3. We have $k^{\\prime} \\equiv s k\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)\\left(\\right.$ or equivalently $\\left.k \\equiv s k^{\\prime}\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)\\right)$.\n\nProof. We write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. Now,\n\n$$\ns k-k^{\\prime}=s(a s+b)-(b s+a)=a\\left(s^{2}-1\\right) \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right),\n$$\n\nas desired.\n\nCombining Facts 2.1 and 2.2, we find that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3} \\ldots$ is eventually periodic with period 2, starting at the first value less than $s^{2}$. From Fact 2.3, it follows that\n\n$$\nk^{\\prime \\prime} \\equiv s k^{\\prime} \\equiv s^{2} k \\equiv k \\quad\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nand hence the sequence is periodic modulo $s^{2}-1$ from the start with period 2 .\n\nNow, if the sequence contains 1 , the sequence eventually alternates between 1 and $s$ since the twist of 1 is $s$ and vice versa. Using periodicity modulo $s^{2}-1$, we must have $n \\equiv 1, s$ $\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$. Conversely, if $n \\equiv 1, s\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ then the eventual period must contain at least one value congruent to either 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. Since these values must be less than $s^{2}$, this implies that the sequence eventually alternates between 1 and $s$, showing that it contains a 1 .",
            "We give an alternate proof of the direct implication: if the sequence contains a 1 , then the first term is 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. We prove the following fact.\n\nFact 3.1. For all $k \\geq s^{2}$, we have $\\left(k-s^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime} \\in\\left\\{k^{\\prime}, k^{\\prime}-s^{2}+1\\right\\}$.\n\nProof. We write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. Since $k \\geq s^{2}$, we have $a \\geq s$. If $b<s-1$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(k-s^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime}=((a-s) s+(b+1))^{\\prime}=(b+1) s+(a-s)=b s+a=k^{\\prime} .\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, if $b=s-1$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(k-s^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime}=((a-s+1) s+0)^{\\prime}=0 s+(a-s+1)=a-s+1=k^{\\prime}-s^{2}+1 .\n$$\n\nNow assume $n \\geq s^{2}$ and the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ contains a 1 . Denote by $e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots$ the sequence constructed as in the problem statement, but with initial value $e_{1}=n-s^{2}+1$. Using the above fact, we deduce that $e_{i} \\equiv d_{i}\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ and $e_{i} \\leq d_{i}$ for all $i \\geq 1$ by induction on $i$. Hence, the sequence $e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots$ also contains a 1 .\n\nSince the conclusion we are trying to reach only depends on the residue of $d_{1}$ modulo $s^{2}-1$, we conclude that without loss of generality we can assume $n<s^{2}$.\n\nFact 2.2. If $k \\leq s^{2}-1$, then $k^{\\prime} \\leq s^{2}-1$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=k$.\n\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k<s^{2}$, then it must hold $1 \\leq a, b<s$, hence $k^{\\prime}=b s+a<s^{2}$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=(b s+a)^{\\prime}=a s+b=k$.\n\nUsing Fact 2.2, it now follows that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ is periodic with period two. Since 1 and $s$ are twists of each other, it follows that if this sequence contains a 1, it must be alternating between 1 and $s$. Hence, $d_{1} \\equiv 1, s\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ as desired.\n\nFor the other direction we can make a similar argument, observing that the second of the two cases in the proof of Fact 3.1 can only apply to finitely many terms of the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\ldots$, allowing us to also go the other way.",
            "First assume that $d_{k}=1$ for some $k$. Let $k$ be the smallest such index. If $k=1$ then $n=1$, so we may assume $k \\geqslant 2$.\n\nThen $d_{k-1}=a s+b$ for some non-negative integers $a, b$ satisfying $b<s$ and $b s+a=1$. The only solution is $b=0, a=1$, so $d_{k-1}=s$. So, if $k=2$, then $n=s$, so we may assume $k \\geqslant 3$.\n\nThen there exist non-negative integers $c, d$ satisfying $d_{k-2}=c s+d, d<s$ and $d s+c=s$. We have two solutions: $d=0, c=s$ and $d=1, c=0$. However, in the second case we get $d_{k-2}=1$, which contradicts the minimality of $k$. Hence, $d_{k-2}=s^{2}$. If $k=3$, then $n=d_{1}=s^{2}$, which gives remainder 1 when divided by $s^{2}-1$.\n\nAssume now that $k \\geqslant 4$. We will show that for each $m \\in\\{3,4, \\ldots, k-1\\}$ there exist $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{m-2} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, s-1\\}$ such that\n\n$$\nd_{k-m}=s^{m}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{m-i}-s^{m-i-2}\\right) \\tag{9}\n$$\n\nWe will prove this equality by induction on $m$. If $m=3$, then $d_{k-3}=a_{1} s+b_{1}$ for some non-negative integers $a_{1}, b_{1}$ satisfying $b_{1}<s$ and $b_{1} s+a_{1}=d_{k-2}=s^{2}$. Then $a_{1}=s^{2}-b_{1} s$, so $d_{k-3}=s^{3}-b_{1}\\left(s^{2}-1\\right)$, which proves (9) for $m=3$.\n\nAssume that (9) holds for some $m$ and consider $d_{k-(m+1)}$. There exist non-negative integers $a_{m-1}, b_{m-1}$ such that $d_{k-(m+1)}=a_{m-1} s+b_{m-1}, b_{m-1}<s$ and $d_{k-m}=b_{m-1} s+a_{m-1}$. Using the inductive assumption we get\n\n$$\na_{m-1}=d_{k-m}-b_{m-1} s=s^{m}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{m-i}-s^{m-i-2}\\right)-b_{m-1} s\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{k-(m+1)} & =a_{m-1} s+b_{m-1}=s^{m+1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{m-i}-s^{m-i-2}\\right) s-b_{m-1} s^{2}+b_{m-1} \\\\\n& =s^{m+1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} b_{i}\\left(s^{m+1-i}-s^{m-i-1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich completes the proof of (9). In particular, for $m=k-1$ we get\n\n$$\nd_{1}=s^{k-1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{k-3} b_{i}\\left(s^{k-i-1}-s^{k-i-3}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe above sum is clearly divisible by $s^{2}-1$, and it is clear that the remainder of $s^{k-1}$ when divided by $s^{2}-1$ is 1 when $k$ is odd, and $s$ when $k$ is even. It follows that the remainder when $n=d_{1}$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$.\n\n\n\nTo prove the other implication, assume that $n$ gives remainder 1 or $s$ when divided by $s^{2}-1$. If $n \\in\\left\\{1, s, s^{2}\\right\\}$, then one of the numbers $d_{1}, d_{2}$ and $d_{3}$ is 1 . We therefore assume that $n>s^{2}$. Since the reminder when a power of $s$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $s^{m}-n$ is non-negative and divisible by $s^{2}-1$. By our assumption $m \\geqslant 3$. We also take the smallest such $m$, so that $n>s^{m-2}$. The quotient $\\frac{s^{m}-n}{s^{2}-1}$ is therefore smaller than $s^{m-2}$, so there exist $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-2} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, s-1\\}$ such that $\\frac{s^{m}-n}{s^{2}-1}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i} s^{i-1}$. It follows that\n\n$$\nn=s^{m}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{i+1}-s^{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now show that\n\n$$\nd_{j}=s^{m+1-j}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i+1}-s^{i-1}\\right) \\tag{10}\n$$\n\nfor $j=1,2, \\ldots, m-2$ by induction on $j$. For $j=1$ this follows from $d_{1}=n$. Assume now that (10) holds for some $j<m-2$. Then\n\n$$\nd_{j}=\\left(s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=2}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i}-s^{i-2}\\right)-b_{1} s\\right) s+b_{1}\n$$\n\nAs $d_{j}$ is positive and $b_{1} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, s-1\\}$, the expression $s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=2}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i}-s^{i-2}\\right)-b_{1} s$ has to be non-negative, so we can compute the twist of $d_{j}$ as\n\n$$\nd_{j+1}=b_{1} s+s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=2}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i}-s^{i-2}\\right)-b_{1} s=s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i+1}-s^{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich finishes the induction.\n\nNow we use (10) for $j=m-2$ and get $d_{m-2}=s^{3}-b_{1}\\left(s^{2}-1\\right)=\\left(s^{2}-b_{1} s\\right)+b_{1}$. Then $d_{m-1}=b_{1} s+s^{2}-b_{1} s=s^{2}=s \\cdot s+0, d_{m}=0 \\cdot s+s=s=1 \\cdot s+0$ and $d_{m+1}=0 \\cdot s+1=1$."

Furthermore, let $U$ be the intersection of the tangent to $\\Omega$ at $S_{b}$ with the line $A B$, and let $V$ be the intersection of the tangent to $\\Omega$ at $S_{c}$ with the line $A C$. Then $T V A U$ is parallelogram. Morover, due to equality of tangent segments we have $\\left|U S_{b}\\right|=\\left|U P_{b}\\right|,\\left|V P_{c}\\right|=\\left|V S_{c}\\right|$ and $\\left|T S_{b}\\right|=\\left|T S_{c}\\right|$.

This implies $\\left|M N_{a}\\right|=|M A|=|M I|$, since $M$ is the midpoint of $S_{c} S_{b}$ and lies also on $O T$. Hence, $M$ is the circumcentre of triangle $I A N_{a}$. But this triangle has a right angle at $A$ (since $A I$ and $A N_{a}$ are the inner and outer angle bisector at $A$ ), hence $M$ lies on $I N_{a}$.\n\nAgain, let $X$ be the second intersection of $T A$ and $\\Omega$. By the above, it suffices to prove that $X$ lies on the line $N_{a} M$. From the power of point $T$ with respect to $\\Omega$ we get $|T A| \\cdot|T X|=\\left|T S_{c}\\right|^{2}$. Since $M$ is the foot of the altitude of right triangle $T S_{c} O$, we obtain $\\left|T S_{c}\\right|^{2}=|T M| \\cdot|T O|$. Hence, $|T A| \\cdot|T X|=|T M| \\cdot|T O|$ so the points $O, M, A, X$ are concyclic. It follows that $\\angle M X A=\\angle M O A=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle N_{a} O A=\\angle N_{a} X A$. Hence, $X$ lies on the line $N_{a} M$.\n\nRemark. To show that $O M A X$ is cyclic, one can also invert the line $T A X$ in the circumcircle of the triangle $A B C$.\n\nSolution 4. \nPart I: First we show that A lies on the radical axis of $\\omega_{b}$ and $\\omega_{c}$.\n\nWe first note that the line through the intersections of two circles is the radical line of the two circles. Let the tangents to $\\Omega$ at $S_{b}$ and $S_{c}$ intersect at $T$. Clearly $T$ is on the radical axis of $\\omega_{b}$ and $\\omega_{c}$ (and in fact is the radical centre of $\\omega_{b}, \\omega_{c}$ and $\\Omega$ ).\n\nWe next show that $A$ lies on the radical axis of $\\omega_{b}$ and $\\omega_{c}$. Let $P_{b}$ denote the point of tangency of $\\omega_{b}$ and $A B$, and let $P_{c}$ denote the point of tangency of $\\omega_{c}$ and $A C$. Furthermore, let $U$ be the intersection of the tangent to $\\Omega$ at $S_{b}$ with the line $A B$, and let $V$ be the intersection of the tangent to $\\Omega$ at $S_{c}$ with the line $A C$. Then $T V A U$ is parallelogram. Morover, due to equality of tangent segments we have $\\left|U S_{b}\\right|=\\left|U P_{b}\\right|,\\left|V P_{c}\\right|=\\left|V S_{c}\\right|$ and $\\left|T S_{b}\\right|=\\left|T S_{c}\\right|$.

In particular, $\\angle N_{a} O T=\\angle T O A$. The conclusion of the problem trivially holds if $|A B|=|A C|$, therefore we assume without loss of generality that $|A C|>|A B|$. Let $S_{a}$ be the midpoint of the $\\operatorname{arc} B C$ which does not contain $A$. Then $N_{a} S_{a}$ is a diameter, so $\\angle S_{a} B N_{a}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\angle O S_{c} T$. We also compute $\\angle B N_{a} S_{a}=\\angle B A S_{a}=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A C=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle S_{c} T S_{b}=\\angle S_{c} T O$. It follows that the triangles $T S_{c} O$ and $N_{a} B S_{a}$ are similar.

Consequently, by (14) the triangles $T S_{c} A$ and $N_{a} B I$ are similar and therefore $\\angle S_{c} T A=\\angle B N_{a} I$. Now let $Q$ be the second intersection of $N_{a} I$ with $\\Omega$. Then $\\angle B N_{a} I=\\angle B N_{a} Q=\\angle B A Q$, so $\\angle S_{c} T A=\\angle B A Q$. Since $A B$ is parallel to $T S_{c}$, we get $A Q \\| T A$, i.e. $A, T, Q$ are collinear.\n\nRemark. After proving similarity of triangles $T S_{c} O$ and $N_{a} B S_{a}$ one can use spiral symmetry to show similarity of triangles $T S_{c} A$ and $N_{a} B I$.",

Moreover, let $P_{b}=A B \\cap S_{b} S_{c}$ and $P_{c}=$ $A C \\cap S_{b} S_{c}$.

For solving the problem, we have prove that $N_{a}=N$.\n\nThe triples of points $A, I, S_{a} ; B, I, S_{b}$ and $C, I, S_{c}$ are collinear because they lie on the angle bisectors of the triangle $A B C$.\n\nNotice that the quadrilateral $A S_{c} X S_{b}$ is harmonic, because the tangents at $S_{b}$ and $S_{c}$, and the line $A X$ are concurrent at $T$. This quadrilateral can be projected (or inverted) to the quadrilateral $S_{a} C N B$ through $I$. So, $S_{a} C N B$ also is a harmonic quadrilateral. Due to $S_{a} B=S_{a} C$, this implies $N B=N C$, so $N=N_{a}$. Done.",

            "We use the strategy of putting all of the multiples of 3 between 1 and $n$ in the set $C$, all of the remaining even numbers in the set $B$, and all of the remaining numbers in the set $A$. The sums of these sets will not likely all be equal, but we then try to adjust the sums to by moving elements out of $A$ and $B$ into $C$ to try to make these sums equal. (Notice that we can't move elements either into $A$ or $B$, or out of $C$.) We will use the notation $|C|$ to denote the sum of the elements of $C$.\n\nSince we are considering the case of $n$ even and we want to examine multiples of 3 less than or equal to $n$, it makes sense to consider $n$ as having one of the three forms $6 k$, $6 k+2$ or $6 k+4$. (These forms allow us to quickly tell what the greatest multiple of 3 less than $n$ is.)\n\nCase 1: $n=6 k$\n\nIn this case, $C$ contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so the sum of $C$ is greater than one-third of the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$, since if we divide the integers from 1 to $n=6 k$ into groups of 3 consecutive integers starting with 1,2, 3 , then the set $C$ will always contain the largest of the 3 .\n\n\n\nCase 2: $n=6 k+4$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+4$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+4)(6 k+5)=18 k^{2}+27 k+10=3\\left(6 k^{2}+9 k+3\\right)+1$, which is never divisible by 3 . Therefore, $n$ cannot be savage in this case because the integers from 1 to $n$ cannot be partitioned into 3 sets with equal sums.\n\nCase 3: $n=6 k+2$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+2$ is\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+2)(6 k+3)=18 k^{2}+15 k+3$, so the sum of the elements of each of the sets $A, B$ and $C$ should be $6 k^{2}+5 k+1$, so that the sums are equal.\n\nIn this case $C$, contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so $|C| \\geq 3+6+9+\\cdots 6 k=3(1+2+3+\\cdots+2 k)=3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(2 k)(2 k+1)\\right)=6 k^{2}+3 k$\n\nThe set $A$ contains at most the integers $1,3,5,7, \\ldots, 6 k+1$, but does not contain the odd multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $3,9,15, \\ldots, 6 k-3$. Therefore, $|A| \\leq(1+3+5+\\cdots+6 k+1)-(3+9+\\cdots+6 k-3)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[1+6 k+1]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[3+6 k-3]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+1)-k(3 k)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+1$\n\n(To compute the sum of each of these arithmetic sequences, we use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half of the number of terms times the sum of the first and last terms.)\n\nThe set $B$ contains at most the integers $2,4,6,8, \\ldots, 6 k+2$, but does not contain the even multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $6,12, \\ldots, 6 k$. Therefore, $|B| \\leq(2+4+6+\\cdots+6 k+2)-(6+12+\\cdots+6 k)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[2+6 k+2]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[6+6 k]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+2)-k(3 k+3)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+2$\n\nThus, the set $C$ is $2 k+1$ short of the desired sum, while the set $A$ has a sum that is $k$ too big and the set $B$ has a sum that is $k+1$ too big.\n\nSo in order to correct this, we would like to move elements from $A$ adding to $k$, and elements from $B$ which add to $k+1$ all to set $C$.\n\n\n\nSince we are assuming that $n$ is savage, then this is possible, which means that $k+1$ must be even since every element in $B$ is even, so the sum of any number of elements of $B$ is even.\n\nTherefore, $k$ is odd, and so $k=2 l+1$ for some integer $l$, and so\n\n$n=6(2 l+1)+2=12 l+8$, ie. $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nHaving examined all cases, we see that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer."

Let $m$ be the minimum of all of the entries in the array.\n\nChoose an entry in the array equal to $m$, say $A_{r}=m$ for some integer $r$. The same argument can be applied with $B_{r}=m$ if there are no entries equal to $m$ in the top row.\n\nIf not all of the entries $A_{j}$ are equal to $m$, then by moving one direction or the other along the row we will get to some point where $A_{t}=m$ for some integer $t$ but one of its neighbours is not equal to $m$. (If this were not to happen, then all of the entries in both directions would be equal to $m$.)\n\nIf all of the entries $A_{j}$ are equal to $m$, then since not all of the entries in the array are equal to $m$, then there will be an entry $B_{t}$ which is not equal to $m$.\n\nIn other words, since not all of the entries in the array are equal, then there exists an integer $t$ for which $A_{t}=m$ and not all of $A_{t-1}, A_{t+1}, B_{t}$ are equal to $m$.\n\nBut $3 m=3 A_{t}$ and $3 A_{t}=A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1}$ so $3 m=A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1}$.\n\nSince not all of $A_{t-1}, B_{t}$ and $A_{t+1}$ are equal to $m$ and each is at least $m$, then one of these entries will be greater than $m$.\n\nThis means that $A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1} \\geq m+m+(m+1)=3 m+1>3 m$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore our assumption that not all of the entries are equal must be false, which means that all of the entries are equal, which proves statement $(\\mathrm{P})$.\n\nProof of statement (Q)\n\nSuppose that all of the entries are positive real numbers.\n\nAssume that not all of the entries in the array are equal.\n\nAs in (b), define $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}$ for each integer $k$.\n\nAlso, define $D_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}$ for each integer $k$.\n\nStep 1: Prove that the numbers $S_{k}$ form an arithmetic sequence\n\nFrom (b), $S_{k+1}=2 S_{k}-S_{k-1}$.\n\nRe-arranging, we see $S_{k+1}-S_{k}=S_{k}-S_{k-1}$ for each integer $k$, which means that the differences between consecutive pairs of terms are equal.\n\nSince this is true for all integers $k$, then the difference between each pair of consecutive\n\n\n\nterms through the whole sequence is constant, which means that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nStep 2: Prove that $S_{k}$ is constant\n\nSuppose that $S_{0}=c$. Since $A_{0}>0$ and $B_{0}>0$, then $S_{0}=c>0$.\n\nSince the terms $S_{k}$ form an arithmetic sequence, then the sequence is either constant, increasing or decreasing.\n\nIf the sequence of terms $S_{k}$ is increasing, then the common difference $d=S_{1}-S_{0}$ is positive.\n\nNote that $S_{-1}=c-d, S_{-2}=c-2 d$, and so on.\n\nSince $c$ and $d$ are constant, then if we move far enough back along the sequence, eventually $S_{t}$ will be negative for some integer $t$. This is a contradiction since $A_{t}>0$ and $B_{t}>0$ and $S_{t}=A_{t}+B_{t}$.\n\nThus, the sequence cannot be increasing.\n\nIf the sequence of terms $S_{k}$ is decreasing, then the common difference $d=S_{1}-S_{0}$ is negative.\n\nNote that $S_{1}=c+d, S_{2}=c+2 d$, and so on.\n\nSince $c$ and $d$ are constant, then if we move far along the sequence, eventually $S_{t}$ will be negative for some integer $t$. This is also a contradiction since $A_{t}>0$ and $B_{t}>0$ and $S_{t}=A_{t}+B_{t}$.\n\nThus, the sequence cannot be decreasing.\n\nTherefore, since all of the entries are positive and the sequence $S_{k}$ is arithmetic, then $S_{k}$ is constant, say $S_{k}=c>0$ for all integers $k$.\n\nStep 3: Determine range of possible values for $D_{k}$\n\nWe note that $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$ and $A_{k}>0$ and $B_{k}>0$.\n\nSince $A_{k}>0$, then $B_{k}=S_{k}-A_{k}=c-A_{k}<c$.\n\nSimilarly, $A_{k}<c$.\n\nTherefore, $0<A_{k}<c$ and $0<B_{k}<c$.\n\nSince $D_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}$, then $D_{k}<c-0=c$ and $D_{k}>0-c=-c$.\n\nIn other words, $-c<D_{k}<c$.\n\nStep 4: $D_{k+1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k-1}$\n\nUsing a similar approach in our proof of lemma (b)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 D_{k} & =3 A_{k}-3 B_{k} \\\\\n3 D_{k} & =\\left(A_{k-1}+B_{k}+A_{k+1}\\right)-\\left(B_{k-1}+A_{k}+B_{k+1}\\right) \\\\\n3 D_{k} & =\\left(A_{k+1}-B_{k+1}\\right)+\\left(A_{k-1}-B_{k-1}\\right)-\\left(A_{k}-B_{k}\\right) \\\\\n3 D_{k} & =D_{k+1}+D_{k-1}-D_{k} \\\\\n4 D_{k}-D_{k-1} & =D_{k+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nStep 5: Final contradiction \n\n$\\text { We want to show that } D_{k}=0$ for all integers $k$.\n\nThis will show that $A_{k}=B_{k}$ for all integers $k$.\n\nSince $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$, then this would show that $A_{k}=B_{k}=\\frac{1}{2} c$ for all integers $k$, meaning that all entries in the array are equal.\n\nSuppose that $D_{k} \\neq 0$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe may assume that $D_{0} \\neq 0$. (If $D_{0}=0$, then because the array is infinite in both directions, we can shift the numbering of the array so that a column where $D_{k} \\neq 0$ is\n\n\n\nlabelled column 0.)\n\nThus, $D_{0}>0$ or $D_{0}<0$.\n\nWe may assume that $D_{0}>0$. (If $D_{0}<0$, then we can switch the bottom and top rows of the array so that $D_{0}$ becomes positive.)\n\nSuppose that $D_{1} \\geq D_{0}>0$.\n\nThen $D_{2}=4 D_{1}-D_{0} \\geq 4 D_{1}-D_{1}=3 D_{1}$. Since $D_{1}>0$, this also means that $D_{2}>D_{1}>0$.\n\nSimilarly, $D_{3}=4 D_{2}-D_{1} \\geq 4 D_{2}-D_{2}=3 D_{2}>D_{2}>0$. Since $D_{2} \\geq 3 D_{1}$, then $D_{3} \\geq 9 D_{1}$. Continuing in this way, we see that $D_{4} \\geq 27 D_{1}$ and $D_{5} \\geq 81 D_{1}$ and so on, with $D_{k} \\geq 3^{k-1} D_{1}$ for each positive integer $k \\geq 2$. Since the value of $D_{1}$ is a fixed positive real number and $D_{k}<c$ for all integers $k$, this is a contradiction, because the sequence of values $3^{k-1}$ grows without bound.\n\nThe other possibility is that $D_{1}<D_{0}$.\n\nHere, we re-arrange $D_{k+1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k-1}$ to obtain $D_{k-1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k+1}$.\n\nThus, $D_{-1}=4 D_{0}-D_{1}>4 D_{0}-D_{0}=3 D_{0}>D_{0}>0$.\n\nExtending this using a similar method, we see that $D_{-j}>3^{j} D_{0}$ for all positive integers $j$ which will lead to the same contradiction as above.\n\nTherefore, a contradiction is obtained in all cases and so it cannot be the case that $D_{k} \\neq 0$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince $D_{k}=0$ and $S_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$, then $A_{k}=B_{k}=\\frac{1}{2} c$ for all integers $k$, which means that all entries in the array are equal."

            "First note that the condition $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|=2$ for all $D$ implies that $\\operatorname{pop}(T)=|\\operatorname{dish}(T)|$, using the equation from problem 5 . So for the town in question, the population of the town equals the number of dishes in the town. Because no two chefs cook the same pair of dishes, it is impossible for such a town to have exactly two residents, and because each dish is cooked by exactly two chefs, it is impossible for such a town to have only one resident.\n\nThe claim is true for towns of three residents satisfying the conditions: such towns must have one resident who cooks dishes $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, one resident who cooks dishes $d_{2}$ and $d_{3}$, and one resident who cooks dishes $d_{3}$ and $d_{1}$, and those three residents form a cycle. So proceed by (modified) strong induction: assume that for some $n>3$ and for all positive integers $k$ such that $3 \\leq k<n$, every town $T$ with $k$ residents and $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|=2$ for all $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$ can be divided into a finite number of resident cycles such that each resident belongs to exactly one of the cycles. Let $T_{n}$ be a town of $n$ residents, and arbitrarily pick resident $r_{1}$ and dishes $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ cooked by $r_{1}$. Then there is exactly one other resident $r_{2}$ who also cooks $d_{2}$ (because $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T_{n}}\\left(d_{2}\\right)\\right|=2$ ). But $r_{2}$ also cooks another dish, $d_{3}$, which is cooked by another resident, $r_{3}$. Continuing in this fashion, there can be only two outcomes: either the process exhausts all the residents of $T_{n}$, or there exists some resident $r_{m}, m<n$, who cooks the same dishes as $r_{m-1}$ and $r_{\\ell}$ for $\\ell<m-1$.\n\nIn the former case, $r_{n}$ cooks another dish; but every dish besides $d_{1}$ is already cooked by two chefs in $T_{n}$, so $r_{n}$ must also cook $d_{1}$, closing the cycle. Because every resident is in this cycle, the statement to be proven is also true for $T_{n}$.\n\nIn the latter case, the same logic shows that $r_{m}$ cooks $d_{1}$, also closing the cycle, but there are other residents of $T_{n}$ who have yet to be accounted for. Let $C_{1}=\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right\\}$, and consider the town $T^{\\prime}$ whose residents are $T_{n} \\backslash C_{1}$. Each of dishes $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$ is cooked by two people in $C_{1}$, so no chef in $T^{\\prime}$ cooks any of these dishes, and no dish in $T^{\\prime}$ is cooked by any of the people in $C_{1}$ (because each person in $C_{1}$ already cooks two dishes in the set $\\operatorname{dish}\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ ). Thus $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T^{\\prime}}(D)\\right|=2$ for each $D$ in $\\operatorname{dish}\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)$. It follows that $\\operatorname{pop}\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)<\\operatorname{pop}(T)$ but $\\operatorname{pop}\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)>0$, so by the inductive hypothesis, the residents of $T^{\\prime}$ can be divided into disjoint resident cycles.\n\nThus the statement is proved by strong induction."

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nFor each odd positive integer $d \\geq 3$, prove that $\\operatorname{gr}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)=d$.",

Thus for each $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)$, $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{\\mathcal{F}_{d}}(D)\\right|$ is even.

This overlap occurs if and only if one of $i$ and $j$ is equal to one of $k$ and $\\ell$. If $i=k$, then $j \\equiv \\ell \\bmod d$. As $j$ and $\\ell$ are both between 1 and $d$, the only way they could be congruent modulo $d$ is if they were in fact equal. That is, $r_{i, j}$ is the same resident as $r_{k, \\ell}$. The other three cases $(i=\\ell, j=k$, and $j=\\ell$ ) are analogous. Thus $f$ is a valid group assignment, proving that $\\operatorname{gr}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right) \\leq d$.

Then $r k-n=2 b$ for some integer $b \\geq 1$, and note that $b<k$ because $r k-k<n$. Then the following strategy turns all of the lights on in $r$ minutes.\n\n- In each of the first three minutes, flip switches 1 through $b$, along with the next $k-b$ switches that have not yet been flipped. This leaves $b+3(k-b)$ lights on, and the rest off. Note that $b+3(k-b)=3 k-2 b=3 k-(r k-n)=n-k(r-3)$.\n- In each of the remaining $r-3$ minutes, flip the first $k$ switches that have never been flipped before.\n\nThis strategy turns on the remaining $k(r-3)$ lights, and Elizabeth escapes the room after $r$ minutes.\n\n\nFirst, if $k$ divides $n$, then $E(n, k)=\\frac{n}{k}=\\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{k}\\right\\rceil$.

        "question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$. In light of this guess, define the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(n, k)$, denoted $I(n, k)$, as\n\n$$\nI(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}\n$$\n\nif $E(n, k) \\neq \\infty$. If $E(n, k)=\\infty$, then by convention, $I(n, k)$ is undefined.\n\nProve that for any integer $x>2$, there exists an ordered pair $(n, k)$ for which $I(n, k)>x$.",

            "First, we prove that if $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, then $E(n, k)=E(n,n-k)$.\n\n\nBecause $n$ is even, and because each switch must be flipped an odd number of times in order to escape, the total number of flips is even. Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.\n\nCall a switch \"non-flipped\" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the \" $(n, k)$ puzzle\" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the \" $(n, n-k)$ \" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips. These sequences last for the same number of minutes, and therefore $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)$.\n\n\nLet $n=2 x$ and $k=2 x-1$ for some positive integer $x$. Then $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, so the above prove applies, and $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)=E(n, 1)=2 x$. Therefore $I(n, k)=2 x-\\frac{2 x}{2 x-1}$. Because $x>2$, it follows that $\\frac{2 x}{2 x-1}<2<x$, so $I(n, k)>x$, as desired."
